# 3G

Acceptable shorthand for third-generation mobile phone.

# 20/20 vision

Use a slash in 20/20.

# Abbreviations and acronyms

## Truncated single words

Not a form that appears very often in *New Scientist* as we make such sparing use of titles (See also section on [Job titles and office holders](#job-titles-and-office-holders)).

Abbreviated forms that end with the same letter as the complete word do not take a full stop at the end:

- Mr

- Mrs

- St (for Saint or Street) as in St Louis, Missouri, St Pancras station

Otherwise, add a full point at the end:

- Rev.

See also sections on [units](#units) and [names](#names-people).

## Names formed from a sequence of initials

True acronyms are not a problem: who even remembers that "radar" and "laser" started out as a string of initials? The problems come with the likes of AIDS, PDA, UN, UNICEF, BSE, EU, GM, CJD, NATO. Which ones need to be spelled out, and which don't?

With a few rare specified exceptions, use caps throughout with no full points, even for abbreviations that are pronounced as a word:

- **NASA** (*not* Nasa)

- **AIDS** (*not* Aids)

Exceptions include:

- *mRNA*

- *vCJD*

## Spell out or not?

This is where it gets complicated.

Unless the abbreviation is included among the exceptions, spell out the name on first mention, followed immediately by the abbreviation in brackets.

- The charity Assisting Marsh Arabs and Refugees (AMAR)

- The Association of Medical Publications (AMP)

Where the first mention is plural, it is permissible to pluralise the abbreviation, too:

- The enzymes known as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs)

But doing the same with the possessive reads awkwardly, so avoid "the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA’s) code". It is almost always preferable to rewrite phrases like this to read, say, "the code drawn up by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)". 

All subsequent mentions can use the abbreviation. But a story littered with strings of capitals looks ugly, so always consider alternatives such as "the anti-doping agency" instead of "WADA" if the meaning is equally clear and the result is not clumsy. 

Where the name is mentioned for a second time immediately after it is introduced (that is, within two lines, when the story is on the page), it is permissible to omit the abbreviation in brackets next to the first mention, and use the abbreviation alone for the second mention.

- Officials at the World Anti-Doping Agency have been busy lately, as WADA races to finalise rules ahead of the Athens Olympics.

## Exceptions

The exceptions fall into three categories.

1. Abbreviations that are almost universally used instead of the full name, and that the overwhelming majority of readers can be expected to recognise. They never need to be spelled out. For example: BBC, HIV, AIDS, DNA, FBI, UN, GDP, GPS

2. Abbreviations that are used more commonly than the full name, but which readers may not recognise. For example, PDA, GSM, PCR. They do not need to be spelled out, but the name should be spelled out and/or explained, whichever is more appropriate.

3. Names that are equally familiar spelled out in full and as abbreviations. They should be spelled out in full on first mentions (without the abbreviation in brackets). Further mentions should use the abbreviation only. For example: European Union/EU; genetically modified/GM; carbon dioxide/CO 2.

# Ableist language

Avoid any language or phrasing that equates a disability with something negative.

Some common examples of ableist language to avoid:

- Fell on deaf ears

- Deaf to our pleas

- Turned a blind eye

- Blind drunk

- Describing something as "crazy" or "mad" etc

This BBC article gives more information: https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210330-the-harmful-ableist-language-you-unknowingly-use

# Achilles' heel

With an apostrophe; not Achilles or Achilles's.

# Accents

Include all accents on **French**, **German**, and **Spanish** names. For anglicised words (e.g. *cafe*, *résumé*), follow [Oxford Dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/).

# AC

Alternating current (but spell out first).

# ACT

Australian Capital Territory — no need to spell out

# Act (law)

If giving the full name of the act, capitalise the main words and put the year after the title:

- Cancer Act 1939

More reader-friendly paraphrases should be lower-cased: eg you might prefer “the 2016 financial services act” to “the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016”.

# AD

Goes before the date, separated by a space: **AD 1492**

# addresses

see [place names](#place-names).

# adds

Don't abuse "she/he adds".

"They found the neutron hiding behind the bikeshed. It's a brilliant bit of research," says John

Smith.

"I could never have imagined this being done five years ago," adds Eva Genius.

Unless the two of them were in the same conversation with the reporter, Eva Genius isn't

adding anything. She is saying it.

# ADHD

Spell out on first mention: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The NHS doesn't classify ADHD as a mental health or psychological condition, so we don’t either.

# Adoption

Only mention that a child is adopted if it is relevant to the story. Use "biological parent" rather than "real parent".

# Adverbs

No hyphen is normally needed between an adverb and the adjective it modifies. For example:

- **a hotly contested result**

- **a constantly evolving theory**

- **genetically modified food**

To avoid any hint of ambiguity, a hyphen is needed after adverbs such as "well" and "ill" that

have the same spelling as the corresponding adjective, as in:

- **a well-dressed man**

- **an ill-considered reply**

No hyphen is need if the adverbial phrase comes after the noun, as in the man was well dressed, because there is no ambiguity in this case.

# African American

No hyphen

African American is a term specific to people in the US and isn’t synonymous with

black/Black.

If a person has expressed a wish to use a specific descriptor, don’t override it.

See also: [Race](#race)

# Age

Use initial caps for specific prehistoric periods: **Stone Age, Iron Age**

But lower case for **ice age**

# ages

For ages of people and things, use numerals: see [time (units of)](#time-units-of)

# ageing

Spell it with an e

# AIDS

No need to spell out. The condition caused by HIV; be specific about what exactly is meant and avoid confusing the two with phrases such as HIV/AIDS

See also: [HIV/AIDS](#hiv-aids), [Medical conditions](#medical-conditions)

# Airbag

One word

# Aircon

One word (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# Air force

Lower case (see army and navy), unless using the proper name of a force, such as the Royal Air Force rather than UK air force.

The US Air Force (that's what they call themselves on their website), the Iraqi air force

# Al-Qaida

Note cap A, hyphen, and "i" in "Qaida"

# America / American

See: [US](#us)

# Americanisms

British usage trumps US equivalents in normal text, so:

Mars is probably the next world astronauts will visit not Mars is likely the next world astronauts will visit (in other words, don't use "likely" as an adverb, although it's fine as an adjective, eg "Mars is a likely next destination.")

Thousands of people protested against the fracking not Thousands of people protested the fracking

Those are a couple of examples not Those are a couple examples

Dee Nyer heads the climate news team not Dee Nyer heads up the climate news team

I have eaten already not I ate already

That isn't a reason to change a vivid Americanism for a bland alternative, though, so long as the meaning will be clear to most English speakers worldwide. Leave Americanisms in direct quotes and interviews alone.

# American spelling

Likewise, British spelling for everything except proper names and direct quotes from written American sources.

# amongst

Avoid it: "among" is usually preferable.

# an

Use for the indefinite article before words beginning with h where the h is silent:

an honourable settlement,

But where the h is voiced, use "a", not "an"

a historic encounter

Use "an" before the letters F, H, L, M, N, R, S or X when they are pronounced, as in an X-rated movie, an NMR scan, an SSSI

# Analogue

Spell it with an -ue (not analog).

# And or &?

Use an ampersand (&) in company names **when the company does**:

- **Marks & Spencer**

- **P&O**

- **Allen & Unwin**

- **Hodder & Stoughton**

- **Simon & Schuster**

- **Secker & Warburg**

- **Johnson & Johnson**

- **Ernst & Young**

- **Thames & Hudson**

- **Procter & Gamble**

- **Weidenfeld & Nicolson**

And in the phrase **R&D**.

But not in:

- **Faber and Faber**

# Angstrom

Don't use (convert to nanometres or picometres, instead).

# Antarctic Peninsula

Capital **P**.

# Antenna

Has two distinct plurals: insects have antennae, cellphones and police cars have antennas

# Antivenom

Use **antivenom** rather than **antivenin**.

# Alpine

Lower case when used to mean relating to high mountains, as in **alpine flora**.

# Arctic

Lower case when used to mean cold:

- **arctic weather**, **an arctic wind**

Capital **A** when referring to the region of the world:

- **the Arctic**, **Arctic fauna**

Lower-case **c** in **Arctic circle**.

# Ares

(rocket) Roman numerals for Ares I, Ares V, etc.

# Army

Upper-case if it's the official name of the army, lower-case otherwise. See also [Air force](#Air-force) and [navy](#navy)

The **US Army**, the **British Army**, the **French army**

# Artefact

Not artifact.

# arXiv.org

The preprint service hosted by Cornell University and part-funded by the US National Science Foundation. The service used to be hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory, which still operates a mirror site at [xxx.lanl.gov](#xxx.lanl.gov). For the sake of consistency always quote the arXiv.org address rather than one of the many mirror sites.

When giving an arXiv.org URL, keep everything lower-case, eg arxiv.org/abs/1712.02766.

# Associations

Correct name takes initial caps, but subsequent mentions of association without full title takes lower case:

The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons questions the idea that someone’s sanity can be restored by taking a drug. A spokesperson for the association said last week...

# Astronomical Terms

Proper names of planets, stars, moons and solar systems start with an upper-case letter, but most other features of our universe start with lower case letters. Terms such as meteorites and meteors are easily confused, so use with care.

- **Asteroid** — relatively small body orbiting the sun. Usually rocky or metallic.

- **Belt** — e.g. Kuiper belt

- **Big bang**

- **Cloud** — e.g. Oort cloud

- **Comet** — relatively small object composed of dirt and ice. Often have dust and gas tails when orbit takes them near the sun.

- **Earth** — avoid “the Earth” where possible

- **Galaxy**

- **Meteor** — shooting star. Space rock/meteoroid passing through and burning up in Earth’s atmosphere.

- **Meteorite** — an object originating in outer space that survives impact with Earth's surface.

- **Meteoroid** — small particle from an asteroid or comet.

- **Milky Way**

- **Moon** — lower case even for the one orbiting Earth

- **Sun** — lower case even for the one in our solar system

- **Universe**

# AU

Standard abbreviation for astronomical unit. It is equal to the average distance from the sun to Earth, and should normally be glossed as such.

# Autism

We need to take particular care when we have articles on autism. It's a delicate subject and it's easy to offend people with poor wording.

Terms to use:

- **Autism**

- **Is autistic**

- **Autistic person**

- Is on the autism spectrum

Person with autism is OK in quotes but many autistic people dislike it so avoid elsewhere in copy

Avoid or be careful about using:

- disorder; prefer **condition**

- psychiatric disorder; prefer **condition**

- illness; prefer **condition**

- cure

- treatment; prefer **intervention or support** , but it's best to spell out what we mean.

- disability; prefer **condition**

- syndrome; prefer **condition**

- **high functioning** or **low functioning**

Some things to remember:

- Autism is not a psychiatric disorder or illness

- Many people feel that autism is a variation on what it means to be human – neurodiverse, rather than neurotypical - and it can be a defining/positive thing. So to suggest it is an illness or that there might be a cure or treatment for autism can be offensive

- An autism-like condition in an animal model is not autism, because autism is an exclusively human condition

# Autonomous vehicles or drones

Use drone rather than unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). These phrases are acceptable in a quote, but only if the context makes it clear what we are talking about.

# Autumn

See: [seasons](#seasons)

# Bail out

A prisoner, a company or person in financial difficulty; you also bail (not bale) out a boat and bail out from aircraft. The noun is bail-out (with a hyphen)

# BAME

Don’t use unless it is in a quote or it is how the researchers define their study group.

If it is used by researchers, ask how they define it.

Spell out on first mention: Black, Asian and minority ethnic.

Alternatives:

- Be more specific – use the specific group that you are referring to.

- Ethnic minority

See also: [race](#race)

# Barcode

One word.

# Basel

Not Basle (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# BBC One, BBC Two

Non-British readers won’t know that they are TV channels, so say so explicitly unless the context already makes this clear

# BBC Online

Capital **O**.

# BC

Goes **after** the date, separated by a space:

- **2000 BC**

See also: [AD](#ad)

# BCE

Don’t use. (Use [BC](#bc) instead)

# Bern

No “e” at the end (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# Berlin Wall

Capital **W**.

# Beta-amyloid

Not amyloid beta.

# Biannual

Don’t use it, as it is too easily confused with biennial, which means once every two years. Twice-yearly means the same as biannual and is unambiguous

# Bible

Initial cap if referring to Old or New Testament; lower case in phrases such as "Atkins’s book is the chemist’s bible"; biblical is always lower case

# Big bang 

Lower case

# big pharma/big tobacco

Lower case

# Billion

Means a thousand million, 10^9 ; not even dyed-in-the-wool old Brits now think otherwise. Can

abbreviate to bn in graphics.

# Biopiracy

One word.

# bioRxiv

Spelled thus, no italics.

# Biosafety

One word.

# Birth defects

Avoid using this term, as people with disabilities don’t have ‘defects’.

Where possible, talk about the specific condition a person has.

If talking more generally, alternatives include born with disabilities or congenital conditions.

# Bitcoin

Always lower case.

# Book titles

See: [books, films, plays, TV programmes, songs, records, works of art, etc](#books-films-plays-tv-programmes-songs-records-works-of-art-etc)

# Both

Often redundant in phrases of the form "both A and B", so always ask yourself whether it is needed. Use only when you need to emphasise that the statement applies to A as much as to B.

In constructions that include a preposition, do not repeat the preposition if it comes before "both" but you must repeat it if it comes afterwards:

Good: either both to the north and to the south or to both the north and the south. 

Bad: both to the north and the south.

The same rule applies to **either...or** , **neither... nor** and **not only...but also**.

# Britain

When referring to the state, use UK rather than Britain: it is shorter and more accurate. 

British is acceptable as an adjective. 

Use Britain when referring to the geographical entity rather than the political one (that is, the island comprised of England, Scotland and Wales) and for historical references further back than 1801, which is when the UK came into being.

# Bronze Age

Use initial caps. (See [Age](#Age))

# Burma

Avoid. Use Myanmar instead. See this Guardian article for a good explanation of why Myanmar is now preferred. [Why Myanmar is now preferred – Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-burma-myanmar-and-faltering-steps-toward-democracy)

# Bushfire 

One word

# Bushmeat

One word.

# Bushmen

Don’t use as it is considered derogatory. Use the name of the specific group, or San people if talking more widely.

# Cambridge

There is only one University of Cambridge, so there is no need to say it is in the UK. 

But there are two cities called Cambridge where events reported in New Scientist frequently take place, so specify whether the one being referred to is in the UK or in Massachusetts, unless the context (pinning the event down to the university, for example) makes this unnecessary.

# canals

Lower-case c for names of canals

Manchester ship canal; exceptions Panama Canal, Suez Canal

See [geographical features](#geographical-features)

# CD-ROM

All caps, with a hyphen

# CE

Don’t use (use [AD](#ad) instead).

# CEO

Acceptable as an abbreviation for chief executive officer

# cellphone

One word (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford dictionaries)

# CERN

Call it "the CERN particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland". (It is actually the European Organization for Nuclear Research, but few people would recognise it by that name.)

# Center

Use American spelling for American organisations and place names:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Rockefeller Center

# Central America

Capital C. Although it's not a continent (it is part of North America), neither is it at the centre

of anywhere in particular (unlike central Asia, central Africa or central Europe)

# centre

Normally it’s centred on: as in

Silicon Valley is centred on Palo Alto

NOT centred around

# century

Always numerals in:

the 9th century

20th-century history

the 1st century BC

(but spell out in contexts such as "the first century after the Romans left Britain")

# Cerenkov radiation

(not Cherenkov)

# chatroom

One word.

# child sexual abuse

Use ‘child sexual abuse images’ or ‘child abuse images’ rather than ‘child pornography’

# Christian name

Avoid; refer instead to "first name" or, if that is unclear, "given name"

# church

Lower case for "church", even when used to mean the Christian religious establishment. Use

caps only when it forms the first part of a name of a particular organisation

the Church of England

the Church of Ireland

but the Catholic church and the Methodist church take lower case

# CJD

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; note the lower-case v in vCJD

# clinical trials

phase I, II and III (lower-case p, roman numerals)

# clock time

Use 2pm, 3.30am unless there is a good reason not to.

2 o’clock, 4 o’clock is acceptable where this is stylistically appropriate

For military, space and similar stories, the 24-hour clock may be more appropriate:

1630 GMT, 1130 Eastern Standard Time

# CO 2 eq

Carbon dioxide equivalent (only the 2 is a subscript; the "eq" is not).

# collective nouns

Do they take a singular or plural verb? It depends on the sense, but use singular where possible.

Research groups, companies, universities, countries, governments and all other organisations, teams or collective bodies take a singular when functioning as an entity. But use a plural noun when the sense relates to the members of these collectives acting independently of each other.

Above all, avoid drifting from singular to plural in references to, say, a research group.

Choose whichever is more appropriate and stick to it. If that leaves you with an awkward sentence rewrite it: using "the researchers" instead of "the team" can sometimes get you out of a mess.

The abstract entities mathematics, physics, statistics, acoustics, economics, politics, etc always take a singular noun. But when they are preceded by the definite article (or could be) statistics (meaning a set of figures), economics (meaning financial detail), politics (meaning a set of activities or political beliefs) take a plural noun

# comets

Lower-case c for comet in names. And where the comet’s name includes a number, do not hyphenate

comet Wild 2, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9

For particularly well-known comets, especially Halley’s comet, "comet" can go after the name.

# commas

The *Chicago Manual of Style* devotes 15 pages to rules on use of the comma. Here are three to be going on with:

## defining and descriptive clauses

Note the difference between these two sentences

"The man who was wearing a hat was walking down the street."

(There were several men, but only the one wearing the hat was walking down the street.) In this sentence "who was wearing a hat" **defines** which man we are talking about, and so is *not* set off between commas.

Compare this with

"The man, who was wearing a hat, was walking down the street."

(There was one man, and he happened to be wearing a hat as he walked down the street.) In this sentence there is no doubt about which man we are talking about; "who was wearing a hat" merely adds some extra **description**, and therefore *must* be set off between commas.

**A person's name and their description "in parallel"**

Commas are needed around the phrase in parallel (called "in apposition" in the grammar books), whether it is the name or the description:

**The prime minister, Tony Blair, said...**

**Fred Smith, the society's president, said...**

But do not use commas when using "of" or "at" to describe what someone does, as in

**Joe Bloggs of Harvard University said**

## Items in a list

Use commas to separate the items in a list of three or more terms. Do not use a comma before "and" unless it is necessary to resolve an ambiguity:

**The flag is red, white and blue**

**The flags are red, green and white, and blue**

# community

Phrases such as "the scientific community" and "the physics community" are appropriate only where the people in question are acting collectively: for example

**This is evidence that the scientific community can police itself**

Otherwise avoid them. If you just mean "scientists" or "physicists", then say so. And if that seems too boring, then perhaps it is not the words that are the problem but the thought behind them.

# companies, non-profits and other non-academic organisations

Use the name the company or other organisation uses itself, unless it indulges in unduly idiosyncratic capitalisation or punctuation. Capitals in the middle of a name formed by running together two or more other names are acceptable, for example: GlaxoSmithKline

but arbitrary use of capitals is not, so use

**Qinetiq**, *not* **QinetiQ**

**NCipher**, *not* **nCipher**

Don't include Ltd, plc or Inc as part of a company name, except in the rare cases where it would otherwise not be clear that the name refers to a company.

Give an organisation's location if the context does not make it clear. Often the country in which an organisation is based will do. If it is multinational, say where the division or employee in question is based, as giving the location of a global headquarters may not help the reader understand the context better.

# compare to

Expresses the overall similarity of one thing to another. The classic example is:

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day.

**Compare with** means to assess specific differences or similarities:

**Compare the human genome** with **that of a mouse and they turn out to be surprisingly similar.**

# compass points

Lower case for north, south, etc. Hyphens for north-east, south-west, etc. See also [regions](#regions) and [West](#west-western) for "the Western world", etc

# computer games

Title in italics, upper and lower case; if there is a subtitle, only its first word is capped (like movies and books): eg

*Call of Duty: Modern warfare 2*

# conjoined twins

Not Siamese twins

# Congress

The legislature of the US takes an initial cap, but **congressional** is lower case

# constants

Letters representing physical constants should be in italics: for example, the speed of light *c* and the gravitational constant *G*.

# contractions

Contractions such as "there's" "they're", "didn't", "he'll", "she'd" don't automatically make a story more accessible. 

People may speak that way, but in print contractions can appear annoyingly chatty. 

They can often be imprecise too ("it's" can stand for "it is" or "it has") and so can detract from clarity, especially if there are several of them in the same sentence. 

They can also be ugly in print: "they've" or "it'd", for instance.

In general, use the full form in preference to the contraction (even "it is" rather than "it's") unless the result appears stilted or awkward, or kills an effective turn of phrase or rhythm. The exception is for negatives: isn't, can't, won't etc are all acceptable.

In direct quotes and interviews, keep any contractions used in the original.

# county

lower-case c for US counties: **the city of Miami is in Dade county, Florida** **covid-19**

lower-case throughout as it isn't an acronym

# crowdsource

One word

# crowdfund/crowdfunding

One word

# cultural references

An appropriate cultural reference, when timely and precise, can lift a story and add humour. 

It can give us an opportunity to educate and entertain, to reveal our deep insight, our breadth of knowledge (which should encompass every field of art and science throughout history) and can create a bond with readers over a common cultural point.

However, culture consists of more than *Star Trek*, *Doctor Who* and *Game of Thrones*. When science fiction or fantasy references are overused or their use is contrived, they dumb a story down, can be misleading and can make *New Scientist* look [fanboy-ish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(person)#Fanboy), which is hardly the way to appeal to the widest possible audience. 

Referring to classics is a good thing, but constant references to movies/TV shows that have been around for decades (e.g. *Star Trek*, *The Terminator*, *ET*, *The Matrix*) make us look old -- rather than young and in touch with modern culture.

Our job is to point out that the truth is stranger than fiction, not to compare it to fiction. Try to avoid pop-culture references as:

- A shortcut in reporting (i.e. Likening something to a famous prop rather than explaining what it actually does -- "remember *Star Trek*'s tricorder? A team at Redshirt University has basically built one." Well, actually they've made a virusdetecting swab, but that sounds boring)

- A meaningless catchphrase (this story is about winter, let's just chuck in a *GoT* reference even if it doesn't really make sense)

- Something that assumes our readers watch or care about many of these shows

- A de facto validation of the real-world achievement -- so rather than celebrating the real achievement, we appear to be celebrating that something fictional seems a bit more plausible.

Banned except in extreme circumstances:

Winter is coming 

Exterminate!

You will be exterminated!

ET phone home

I'll be back

Hasta la vista

Set phasers to stun

# currencies

Use symbols and numerals when quoting specific amounts of common currencies:

**£5 million (*not* 5 million pounds, or five million pounds)**

**€5 (*not* 5 euros or five euros)** **about \$3.5 billion (not about 3.5 billion dollars)**

The same applies to Canadian dollars (CAN\$), Australian dollars (AUS\$) and New Zealand dollars (NZ\$).

Where you do need to spell out the currency unit, when talking about vague amounts, it is always lower case as in

The floods in 2002 cost Germany billions of euros

On the rare occasions when you will need to use other currencies, they should be spelled out:

35,000 yen

1.6 million roubles

Unlike other units, no hyphens are needed in: "a £50 million project"

## conversions

Amounts quoted in sterling, US dollars and euros do not normally need to be converted. The only exception might be if you want readers to be able to make direct comparisons between countries: if that applies you should choose one as the standard.

Any other currency should be converted the first time it is mentioned to the equivalent in US dollars. There are a number of currency converters on the net: the [XE](http://www.xe.com/) and [OANDA](http://www.oanda.com/) sites cover any currency you are likely to encounter.

Currencies change from day to day, so exact conversions are inappropriate. Round them up or down to a sensible figure. Remember too that official exchange rates can be misleading when it comes to people's purchasing power, and [alternative](http://www.worldbank.org/data/icp/documents/prem-note.doc)conversion rates may be more appropriate, where available

Take care too with historical comparisons: exchange rates can shift over the long term. Again, [OANDA](http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates/) has a useful function for working out historical exchange rates.

# cyber-

Follow the [Oxford Dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/) for compound words created for the cyber age. Most are one word, e.g. cyberattack, cyberbullying, cybercrime, cybersecurity, cyberspace, cyberterrorism, cyberwar.

# dam

Lower-case d for names of dams Hoover dam; Aswan high dam

# Darwin

For the preferred title of Charles Darwin's seminal work see On the Origin of Species.

# dashes

Used sparingly, dashes can add force and welcome variation. Used to excess they are a sure sign of sloppy writing. 

Dashes can be used to signal an abrupt break in a sentence. 

To set off part of a sentence in parentheses, use a pair of dashes rather than brackets. But don’t do this more than once in a sentence, and preferably not more than once in a paragraph. 

If a full stop, comma, colon or semicolon is equally appropriate, always use that instead. 

If you find yourself with text spattered with dashes, recasting it in a more orderly way will make it clearer and less annoying to read. 

When adding a dash to an InCopy document, use an en dash (Alt-hyphen) with spaces before and after. 

Dashes shouldn’t appear at the start of a column line in print – use a nonbreaking space to keep it with the previous word.

# data

Data should be treated as singular. For example, the data shows. 

Some readers may dislike data being used with singular verbs when talking about experimental results, as they may think of a set of results as having individual members that are identifiable and meaningful. However, the original singular, datum, is rarely used in popular media. 

Even so, it is recommended to mix it up with other words, such as "readings", "information", "measurements", "results" and "findings", in these cases for variety. Plural data is fine in quotes.

# dates

Plain numerals for date (6 *not* 6^th^; 22 *not* 22^nd^) followed by month (spelled out) followed by year in full:

**5 March 1983**

# days

See [time (units of)](#time-units-of)

# Deaf and deaf

Use deaf when we mean the condition of not hearing.

Use Deaf when we mean the community of people who share a language, for example British Sign Language or American Sign Language, and culture.

When talking about a specific individual always use the descriptor they would use themselves.

People who are Deaf share a language, history and culture that is a strong part of their identity. For this reason, be careful when talking about cures and treatments for deafness -- not everyone sees being deaf as a lack or as something to be 'fixed'

Phrases to avoid:

Deaf-mute -- people who are deaf aren't silent or without a voice -- they can sign, write or have other ways of communicating. Use deaf, Deaf or British Sign Language user (or equivalent)

Deaf and dumb

Hearing-impaired -- use deaf, Deaf or hard of hearing

lost their hearing -- some people who were born deaf or Deaf haven't lost anything, so use with care

The National Association of the Deaf has a good glossary of terms

[https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/community-and-culturefrequently-asked-questions/](https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/community-and-culturefrequently-asked-questions/)

Avoid common phrases that associate deafness with negative things eg deaf to our pleas, fell on deaf ears.

# decades

Use numerals -- the early 1930s, the mid-1940s, the Thatcherite 80s, etc.

# degrees

When referring to angles, spell out "degrees" (as for any other unit):

**The tower at Pisa has a tilt of more than 5 degrees**

For temperature, use °C, closed up to the numeral:

**Ethanol boils at 79°C**

For latitude and longitude use °, closed up to the numeral:

**Lerwick lies at latitude 60° north**

(note the lower case for north -- or south, east or west)

To make a degree (°) symbol on a Mac, use the key combination Alt-Shift-8 

# departments -- university

Always lower case, whether or not the university treats them that way

**Fred Schmidt is at the department of chemistry, at the University of Bonn in Germany** 

# deserts

Lower case **the Sahara desert, the Gobi desert**

# developing country/developed country

Don't use. There is no agreed definition for a 'developing country', which means countries that are vastly different in terms of economic activity are often put together.

A better alternative is to talk in terms of a country's income. The World Bank defines countries based on whether they are a low-income country, lower-middle-income country, higher-middle-income country or high-income country.

Consider whether talking about a specific country or countries is a better alternative to talking about a large group -- even within the World Bank definitions there is lots of variation between countries.

When comparing groups of countries, can use higher-income countries and lower-income countries, and to avoid repetition wealthier countries and poorer countries. Avoid the phrase poor countries.

Similarly, avoid using the terms 'developing world' and 'developed world' -- there is no clean-cut split of the globe into two in this way.

# Devolution (UK)

The UK has a devolved system of government. This means that there are separate governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that act independently of the UK government when creating policy in these policy areas:

- health and social care

- education and training

- local government and housing

- agriculture, forestry and fisheries

- the environment and planning

- tourism, sport and heritage

- economic development and internal transport

Always be clear which country/government you are referring to when discussing policy within the UK. For example, there is no UK NHS, and each nation has a different approach to coronavirus.

The UK government decides policy in England for the above policy areas. Always spell out if a UK government policy only applies to England. The UK government decides policy for the whole of the UK for areas not mentioned in the list.

# diabetes

To distinguish the two types of diabetes, use **type 1** rather than "insulin dependent", and **type 2** rather than "non-insulin dependent" or "adult onset". Depending on the context, you may need to explain what the terms mean. Note the lower-case t and Arabic numerals.

# direction

see [compass points](#compass-points)

# disability

See [medical conditions](#medical-conditions)

Avoid common phrases that associate impairments with negative things eg blind drunk, deaf to our pleas

# disc

Never disk, not even in a computer

# diseases

If their name includes a location, this takes capital letters, even if it is not a specific place, so **East Coast fever, West Nile virus, Lassa fever, Marburg disease, Ebola virus** but **dengue fever, viral haemorrhagic fever, chikungunya etc**

# disfigurement

"Disfigurement" is a term enshrined in the UK's Equalities Act 2010 for someone who has a mark, scar or condition to their face or body that makes them look different.

In most cases it is better to name the condition or cause of the scar or mark than use "disfigurement". An alternative when talking generally is "visible differences".

Words to avoid: deformity, abnormality, defect.

When talking about specific individuals always use the description they use.

# DOI

Used by nearly all journal publishers to provide a permanent online link to scientific papers.

In print, shorten DOI links using the DOI shortener available at [http://shortdoi.org/](http://shortdoi.org/)

Format the references like this: (*Nature*, doi.org/j5d)

If a DOI doesn't shorten, refer to the article like so:

***Science*, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0401773101**

(note the space after the colon)

To look up a DOI, enter the address dx.doi.org/ followed by the DOI itself. For example: **dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0401773101**

# double ententatives

(the name was coined by our own Michael Le Page)

We need to be only so cautious when we are positing something. Being too tentative makes what we are saying less convincing and less compelling. Once you have your tentative word, the rest can generally be a statement.

Avoid: It could mean that depression might be treatable. Prefer: It could mean that depression will be treatable.

# draconian

Lower case

# drug names

Generic names are all lower case; proprietary names begin with a cap. To look up drug names, try the [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/cder/ob/default.html) site and [RxList](http://www.rxlist.com/)

# drug use

Words to avoid:

- Addict, addicted

- drug abuser or user

- drug habit

- alcoholic

- junkie

- reformed addict

Alternatives:

- person who uses drugs

- person with substance use disorder

- person who has a x use disorder

- person in recovery

For more information and alternatives, see p30 of this report: [GCDP Report 2017](http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GCDP-Report2017_Perceptions-ENGLISH.pdf)

# DuPont

Cap D and cap P, all closed up

# Earth

Initial cap when being named as a planetary body:

**The effect of Jupiter's gravity changed the asteroid's course so that it passed close to**

**Earth** **the space shuttle returned to Earth safely**

But lower case when it is another way of saying "the world": **the greatest show on earth**

Also lower case for the soil or the ground **the man who fell to earth; down to earth** and for "earth scientists" and "earth science"

Avoid "the Earth" where possible. One would not refer to something happening on "the Mars" or "the Jupiter". And use Earth-like rather than Earthlike (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# ebook

No hyphen; (but [e-reader](#e-reader))

# ecstasy

(drug) lower case

# -ed or -t?

The following always end in -ed: **learned, dreamed, spelled, smelled** The following always ends in -t **leapt**

The following end in -ed for the simple past, and past participle **burned, spoiled, spilled**

but in -t when used as an adjective **burnt, spoilt, spilt**

# either

See [both](#both)

# elderly

Avoid. Give the age or age range of people being described or use a phrase like 'older people'. Don't use to describe anyone under 75.

# ellipsis

Use the ellipsis character (alt-semicolon in InCopy) in quoted material if you need to signify that material has been omitted from the middle of the original quote. There should be no space before the ellipsis, but it should always be followed by one.

# email

No hyphen; but e-commerce, e-business

# Endeavour

Note the British spelling for NASA space shuttle, which is named after James Cook's ship

# enormity

The Oxford dictionaries define enormity as applying primarily to something that is in some way bad, as in **the enormity of his crimes**

If are referring to the scale, size, or extent of something that is likely to be perceived as good or even just neutral, the word you are looking for may be **immensity**.

# enquiry

A question; an [inquiry](#inquiry) is something grander

# EPFL

Spell out on first mention as the **Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne** (the initials stand for École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)

# epicentre

The point **on the planet's surface** vertically above the **focus** of an earthquake. 

# equator

Lower case e

# e-reader

hyphenated (unlike [ebook](#ebook))

# Eskimo

A term that the people it is applied to often consider offensive, so don't use it unless you are certain that the context requires it and that it will not inadvertently cause offence.

If referring to a specific group or people, use their preferred name.

For more information see: [Inuit or Eskimo](https://www.uaf.edu/anlc/resources/inuit_or_eskimo.php)

# ethnic minorities

In the UK, the term ethnic minorities is used by the government to refer to all ethnic groups bar the white British group. This means it includes white minorities, such as Roma, Gypsy and Irish Traveller groups. For this reason, be careful how you use it.

It is better to be specific about which group we are talking about, where possible.

For more info see: [Ethnicity Facts and Figures](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/style-guide/writing-about-ethnicity)

See also [race](#race)

# EU

Spell out European Union on first mention. Be careful not to refer to the EU when you mean the European Commission: the EU is related to the commission in much the same way as a nation is related to its government.

The UK left the EU, not Europe.

# European Commission

The commission (lower case) after first mention; *not* EC

# exhibitions

Names of exhibitions in roman, with initial caps throughout

# extrasolar

One word (like extraterrestrial and extragalactic)

# families

Be careful when talking about families in general and don't assume they all contain one mother and one father.

# faults (geological)

Lower case:

San Andreas fault

See [geographical features](#geographical-features)

# fetus

Not foetus

# fewer or less?

For things you can count off one by one, use **fewer**; for quantities you can only measure, not count, use **less**.

# Fields medal

Lowercase medal

# foot and mouth disease

No hyphens (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# forego

Means to go before (hardly ever used); to go without is to **forgo**

# foreign and adopted words

Foreign words should be in italic. Where a word has passed into common English usage use roman: be guided by the Oxford Dictionaries. So **Schadenfreude** is in roman, because that's the way it is in the dictionary, while *Schaden* or *Freude* (should you ever need to use them) are in italic

# forensic

Watch out for the phrase "forensic evidence", which upsets a lot of readers. The word "forensic" originally meant "to do with a court", and from this we got the phrase "forensic science", which no one objects to.

However, with the original meaning now almost obsolete, "forensic" has come to be widely used to mean "denoting the application of scientific methods and techniques to the investigation of crime", as the ODE puts it. This has led in turn to usages such as "forensic evidence", and "forensics", but try to avoid these if possible. Try "scientific evidence" and "forensic science" as alternatives.

# former

Using "former" is appropriate when referring collectively to countries that were once a single country but are now separate: e.g.

**Depleted uranium is a problem throughout the former Yugoslavia**

Avoid "former Soviet Union" or "former Yugoslavia" when referring to actions and events involving these countries before they broke up. Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union. It could not possibly have been invaded by the former Soviet Union, because a former country is incapable of invading its neighbour.

# formula

Maths and chemistry books are packed with **formulae**, but lists of ingredients or forms of words are **formulas**

# Formula 1

(Motor racing) Capital F, numeral 1

# fractions

One-quarter, two-thirds, one-tenth, one-hundredth, one-thousandth, one-millionth all spelled out; note the hyphens. Also one-and-a-half, two-and-a-quarter, etc. But no hyphen in: a third, a half, a quarter, etc

Use numerals for fractions of numbers that are not powers of 10: 1/20th, 1/25th

# fresh water

Two words for the noun

**Fresh water is less dense than saltwater**

But one word when used as an adjective: freshwater fish; freshwater habitat

# g

Lower case, italic. The acceleration due to gravity, used as a unit

**The plane had to withstand 5 *g***

But g-force is lower case and hyphenated

# G7

No need to spell out, but unless the context makes it obvious, describe what it is: namely, a group of seven leading industrial countries (France, US, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada). It is not the top seven, because China has the second largest economy (for now).

# Galapagos

No accent

# galaxy

Always lower case, even when referring to our own galaxy

# geek

To be avoided, along with other similar terms like nerd, dweeb and dork, when referring to those with a talent for the sciences.

# gender

We aim to be as inclusive as possible with our language in stories. For this reason, use 'man' and 'woman' with caution -- not all men have a penis, not all women have a vagina and some people are non-binary.

The terms 'man' and 'woman' are fine in quotes or when attributed to an interviewee who used them.

The terms are also ok when reporting on a study that uses these terms, but do make it clear that the study only included those people (eg didn't include trans or non-binary people).

In longer articles, use gender neutral language when talking generally and always include any relevant studies about trans or non-binary people, and if there aren't any, state that.

If 'people' doesn't work as an alternative, then there is usually a way to write around it. 

# gendered language

Avoid this. Use gender-neutral alternatives wherever possible, even when talking about a group of people who happen to share a gender. For instance:

Use **police officers**, *not* policewomen

Use **firefighters**, *not* firemen

Use fishers, not fishermen

Use **actors**, *not* actresses -- though it is the **Academy Award for Best Actress**

Neil Armstrong's achievement was to be the first **person** or **human** to walk on the moon -- *not* the first man

... though Valentina Tereshkova is of course famous for being the **first woman in space** [More alternatives to sexist terms are listed here](http://www.putlearningfirst.com/language/23sexism/sexist.html)

## man/mankind

Avoid using "man" or "mankind" to mean the human race in general, except possibly in direct quotes. "People", "humans" or "humanity", depending on the context, will usually be preferable.

## manned/man-made/unmanned

"Crewed" and "uncrewed" are preferred for craft such as spacecraft, aircraft and ships that are piloted or crewed by humans. Instead of "man-made", try alternatives such as "artificial", "synthetic", "manufactured" and "of human origin".

## spokesperson

Use this rather than **spokesman** or **spokeswoman**. Or avoid: depending on context, "Unilever said" may be better than "a spokesperson for Unilever said". "Spokesperson" is sometimes necessary in stories about experiments at CERN, however, because the lead scientist is often given that title.

# genes and proteins  

Names of genes are italic: *lac*, *ob*, *env*, *Bt*.  

Proteins have the same name as the genes that produce them are in roman.  

When a gene name is used to identify genetically modified plants, e.g. *Bt* maize, the gene name is italicised.

# geoengineering  

One word

# geographical features  

In their official names, use caps or lower case as follows:  

basin  

Bay, e.g. Bay of Biscay  

canal, except for Panama Canal and Suez Canal 

cave 

cliff 

crater 

current, e.g. Humboldt current 

dam, e.g. Hoover dam 

desert, e.g. Kalahari desert 

Deep, e.g. Challenger Deep  

delta 

estuary 

fault 

Forest  

glacier, e.g. Pine Island glacier 

gorge, e.g. Cheddar gorge  

Gulf, e.g. Gulf of Mexico  

Gulf Stream  

hill 

ice sheet, e.g. West Antarctic ice sheet 

ice shelf  

Island  

Lake, e.g. Lake Victoria  

Mount, e.g. Mount Rushmore. Upper case for the proper name of an individual mountain 

mountains, e.g. Rocky mountains. Lower case for the proper name of a mountain range 

oasis, e.g. Dakhla oasis  

Ocean

Passage, e.g. North-West Passage 

peninsula 

plain (except the Great Plains) plateau (plural plateaus)

[pole](#pole) or Pole, depending

pool  

ridge, e.g. Mid-Atlantic ridge  

river, but River when needed to show that a word is a proper name rather than a descriptor, e.g. Thames river, Yellow River  

Sea  

Sound, e.g. Viscount Melville Sound 

slide 

Strait  

trench, e.g. Mariana trench 

valley 

volcano

# geological time divisions  

Initial caps for the standard ones, eg:  

**Mesozoic Era**  

**Ediacaran Period**  

**Late Cretaceous Epoch**  

**Emsian Age**  

The division type (era, epoch and so on) can be omitted after the first mention. But on their own these names mean little, and stating how long ago they were may not help much. It's good to give an indication of what was going on at the time -- what life was around, what the land masses looked like, and so on.

# germline  

All one word (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# God/gods  

The God of the monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc) takes a cap G, and He takes a cap H. The gods in general, and those of polytheistic religions, take a lower-case g.

# government departments  

There is a list of [British government departments](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations) and ministers on the parliament website. Use caps for full names of government departments, lower case for abbreviated names: for example  

Department for Education, **but** education department  

There is a list of [US government departments](http://www.firstgov.gov/Agencies/Federal/Executive.shtml), and their abbreviations, on the Firstgov website. Use caps for full names of government departments, lower case for abbreviated names.

# gram  

Not *gramme*

# green paper  

Provisional report on government proposals, intended for discussion (all lower case - an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# green revolution  

Lower case

# hacker  

Someone who manipulates computer systems to gain access to unauthorised data or for some other mischievous or malevolent purpose. (The battle for "cracker" to be used instead has been lost.)

# The Hague  

Cap T

# Hannover  

*Not* Hanover for the German city

# Harbor  

Use American spelling for American place names:  

**e.g. Pearl Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor**

# headlines  

Capitalise the first letter of the first word and the first letter of any proper name. Nothing else.  

So  

**Mass bleaching hits Great Barrier Reef for second year in a row** *not* **Mass Bleaching Hits Great Barrier Reef for Second Year in a Row**  

Use italics, superscripts and subscripts as you would in body copy.

# healthcare  

One word, not two (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to [Oxford dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# hermaphrodite  

Only use in reference to an animal that can reproduce as either a male or a female.  

For people who fall outside the male/female binary, the correct term is intersex.

# high street  

When used to mean "in shops", use lower case, as in  

**Bluetooth phones are now common on the high street**  

Cap up in proper names, as in  

**We went shopping in Homerton High Street**

# high-tech  

Not hi-tech

# HIV  

No need to spell out. You can be infected with HIV but you don't die from it.

# HIV/AIDS  

Avoid using this phrase wherever possible. 

The virus is HIV; the syndrome it can lead to is AIDS. Most statements we need to make refer to either one or the other. Where referring to them collectively, use "HIV and AIDS". 

Use "HIV/AIDS" only in names (for example, "The Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS") or in direct quotes, although it is questionable whether anyone who doesn't bother to distinguish between HIV and AIDS is worth quoting.

# hominid  

This term is now properly used to describe a member of the family Hominidae, which includes humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans. For humans and our closest relatives use [hominin](#hominin).

# hominin  

The preferred term for the group made up of humans, their ancestors and their extinct cousins, taxonomically the tribe Hominini.

# hospitals  

When naming a hospital, use its full name, which will usually mean the name will include "Hospital" with a cap H: e.g. Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Royal London Hospital

# hotspot  

One word

# Hubble Space Telescope  

Initial caps

# humans  

In most contexts, the word "people" is preferable. But where the intention is to draw a distinction between us and some other species, use "humans" to help to make the point

# hyphens  

Too many hyphens make text look cluttered, so avoid them where you can.

# after an adverb?  

Do not use hyphens to link an adverb to an adjective: **genetically modified food, doubly special relativity**  

The only common exceptions to this are when "well" and "ill" are used as part of a compound adjective preceding the noun, when a hyphen is needed to avoid ambiguity: **well-behaved patients; ill-considered attack**

# compound adjectives  

Use a hyphen in phrases such as  

**Green-belt land, zero-gravity environment, state-of-the-art phones**

# measurements  

A form of compound adjective that crops up a lot in *New Scientist* requires a hyphen to link quantities to their units, as in  

**12-centimetre discs, 3000-kilometre journey**  

(but not when the measurement is not adjectival, as in: the discs measure 12 centimetres across; the 4-hour flight took us 3000 kilometres).  

The same applies when making compound adjective, such as **a 3-metre-long gun barrel**  

otherwise dubiety creeps in. But the construction is ugly. Writing around it, as in "a gun barrel 3 metres long", is more elegant.  

No hyphens with per cent:  

**a 20 per cent solution; a 50 per cent rise** or with sums of money: **a \$3 million budget**

# avoiding ambiguity

Use a hyphen to clarify what would otherwise be an ambiguous phrase, as in **a little-known city**

# compass points

[See here](#compass-points)

# prepositional nouns  

Nouns formed from a verb plus a preposition are often hyphenated:  

**ready for take-off; paying for the clean-up**  

(derived from the verbs "take off" and "clean up", which are not hyphenated)

# ranges (especially dates)  

**In the period 1979-82 funding was in short supply** though this often reads better if reworded: "from 1979 to 1982, funding was in short supply.  

Don't use "2000-2500 years ago" (or, worse, "between 20-25 ºC"). Write "from 2000 to 2500 years ago", "between 20 and 25 ºC" and so on.

# hyphens are also needed in...  

[Fractions](#fractions) and when spelling out numbers such as twenty-one, sixty-six, ninety-nine (although house style will dictate using [numerals](#numbers), except at the start of a sentence).

# hypothesis or theory?  

Both can mean "a possible explanation" in common parlance, but in science they have distinct meanings. Abuse of these terms is common and has contributed to people dismissing evolution as being just a "theory".

- **hypothesis**: a preliminary explanation, or provisional prediction of a causal relationship, that can be tested and disproved. It cannot be proved, however. It is generally associated with a single study or experiment.

- **theory**: a well-substantiated unifying explanation for many observations of the natural world that can include facts, laws, inferences and tested hypotheses. As such, the label "theory" is given only to what we are most certain about, such as quantum theory, the theory of evolution, the theory of relativity, germ theory.

If we are writing about someone who has an interesting idea about how something works, an "idea" is what it is. It is almost certainly not a theory and probably not a hypothesis. It could also be a hunch or a guess.

# ice age  

Use lower case  

An ice age is a period when glaciers are present on the planet - we are currently in one. 

The phrase "the last ice age" refers to the one before, in the late Palaeozoic. 

If you are describing the last time ice sheets reached their maximum extent over North America, Europe and Siberia, it is the last glacial period. 

We are currently in an interglacial period, during an ice age.

# IEEE  

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (spell out on first mention). Its main office is in New York City

# in vitro  

Lower case, roman; never hyphenate

# index  

Books have **indexes**, but numbers raised to a power have **indices**

# Indigenous people  

Upper case Indigenous when talking about people eg, Indigenous people/s, Indigenous knowledge  

Use a group's name wherever possible eg Hadza hunter-gatherer communities

# aboriginal  

Lower case as general term referring to the original inhabitants of an area. But use upper case for the name of specific aboriginal peoples, such as Inuit.

# Australia  

Many consider the term "Aborigine" racist, so avoid it.  

Be as specific as possible -- cultural group is preferred.  

When talking about specific individuals always use the description they use.  

If we are talking about all Indigenous people in Australia, use Indigenous Australians or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Torres Strait Islander people are Indigenous, but not called Aboriginal people.  

Use Aboriginal and Indigenous as adjectives, not nouns.

## Other related terms  

- **Dreaming** rather than Dreamtime  

- **Family groups** instead of clan  

- **Language groups**, not clans  

- **Traditional** over tribal

# Canada  

Indigenous peoples is the preferred term when discussing all Indigenous groups in Canada, and includes First Nations, Inuit and Metis people. 

If you are talking about a specific group, name them.  

Be careful with the term First Nations as it doesn't include Inuit and Metis people.

# industrial revolution  

Lower case

# internet of things  

Lower case, no quotes or hyphens

# inquiry  

A formal or quasi-judicial investigation; also a wide-ranging study or field of study. For a simple question or request for specific information, use [enquiry](#enquiry).

# in real life  

Do not use this when you want to draw a contrast with online things, virtual reality, social media and so on. It's all real life. Think about the specifics of what you mean and say that.

# Instant Messenger  

This is a trademark, belonging to AOL. The generic term is **instant messaging** (all lower case)

# International Space Station  

Takes initial caps

# International Telecommunication Union  

"Telecommunication" is singular

# internet  

Lower case; likewise "the net"

# Iron Age  

Use initial caps (see [Age](#age))

# ironically  

Used too much, and usually incorrectly; it is not a synonym for "unexpectedly" or even "strangely". Reserve it for describing something that has elements of both coincidence and paradox - or genuine irony, of course.

# -ise  

Use the ending "ise", rather than "ize" for words such as "modernise", despite *ODE*'s preference for the z spelling. The same goes for derivations: "modernisation" (not "ization"); "moderniser" (not "izer").

# Islamic State/ISIS  

Islamic State on first mention, ISIS thereafter

# islands  

Takes cap I for names of islands  

**Falkland Islands; Isle of Man** See [geographical features](#geographical-features)

# isotopes  

Spell out on first mention: eg **iodine-131**. If it is mentioned frequently thereafter, it can be abbreviated, eg **I-131**.

# italics  

Italicise [foreign and adopted words](#foreign-and-adopted-words), the titles of [newspapers, magazines, journals, reports and journal articles](#newspapers-magazines-journals-reports-and-journal-articles), [books, films, plays, TV programmes, songs, records, works of art, etc](#books-films-plays-tv-programmes-songs-records-works-of-art-etc), [names of species and genera](#names-(biological)), letters and symbols that stand for a mathematical [variable](#variables), a physical [quantity](#quantities) or for a physical [constant](#constants).

Do not italicise [the names of ships](#ships)

# IUCN  

International Union for Conservation of Nature. Need not be spelled out in short stories (under 100 words) if space is tight and context makes its function clear. (No longer calls itself the World Conservation Union).

# Ivory Coast  

Not Cote D'Ivoire (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to [Oxford dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# job titles and office holders  

No matter how elevated they are, use lower case for the names of particular jobs or offices, even when using them as a shorthand for the people holding them:  

The prime minister, David Cameron, had an audience with the pope this year  

Margaret Thatcher was the UK's first woman prime minister Lyndon Johnson was president during the Vietnam war The queen received the prime minister at Buckingham Palace Fritz Schmidt is professor of pharmacology at...

Cap up the title only when using it as a prefix to a particular person's name:  

As the motorcade passed the grassy knoll, President Kennedy was hit by three bullets  

At the turn of the last century Queen Victoria was on the throne

But use this form sparingly: it is fine for heads of state, but avoid it for anyone else: "the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder," is preferable to "Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany". The further down the hierarchy you go, the worse it sounds: "Vice-President of Marketing Billy Jones" would be fatuous.

However, use initial caps for one-off academic titles such as Astronomer Royal or Enrico Fermi Professor of Physics.

# journals  

See [newspapers, magazines, journals, reports and journal articles](#newspapers-magazines-journals-reports-and-journal-articles)

The following abbreviated journal titles can be used:  

- ***PNAS*** instead of *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*  

- ***JAMA*** instead of *The Journal of the American Medical Association*  

- ***PLoS*** instead of *Public Library of Science*. Likewise for ***PLoS Medicine***, etc. And it's ***PLoS One***, not *PLoS ONE*.  

- ***NEJM*** instead of *The New England Journal of Medicine*  

- ***The BMJ*** now calls itself just that, never the *British Medical Journal*. See [references](#references) for more on journals  

# judgement/judgment  

Use **judgement** unless referring to decisions handed down by judges in a court of law, which is **judgment** (no e).

# just deserts  

Not "just desserts". It is what is deserved rather than a sugary reward.

# kelvin

Spell out on first mention; note the lower-case k (all SI units are lower case when spelled out); can be abbreviated to K in subsequent mentions. And note that it is always kelvin, even when plural (not *kelvins* or *degrees kelvin*).

# kilogram

Not *kilogramme*

# knots

Don't use. [Convert](http://www.onlineconversion.com/speed_common.htm) to kilometres per hour or metres per second instead.

# kph

Don't use. Where it is necessary to abbreviate kilometres per hour, use km/h.

# land grab

Two words (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/)), but land-grabber and land-grabbing. The same applies to [water](#water-grab).

# latitude

See [degrees](#degrees)

# laws, theorems, theories, etc

Use lower case: second law of thermodynamics, special theory of relativity, big bang theory, standard model of particle physics, theory of everything. 

But capitalise the names of people after whom particular laws, theories, etc are named: Newton's second law, Fibonacci series, Fermat's last theorem.

# learning disability and disabilities

Use instead of mental handicap.

Mencap has a good explainer on when to use learning disabilities and when to use learning difficulties: [https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/what-learningdisability](https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/what-learning-disability).

# less

See [fewer](#fewer).

# LGBTQ+

This is the abbreviation we use, no need to spell out that it stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer or questioning. 

Remember, an individual isn't LGBTQ+, the acronym refers to a wider community. 

As with other personal details, only mention someone's sexual orientation or gender identity if it is relevant to the story, and use the descriptor they prefer.

# licence/license

With a c it is a noun, with an s it is a verb. See [practice/practise](#practice-practise). Think "advice" and "advise".

# lifelog/lifelogger/lifelogging

All one word.

# like/as if

Avoid using "like" to introduce a clause in constructions such as "she was behaving like she owned the place". The correct form is She was behaving **as if** she owned the place.

# like/such as

There is a subtle difference in meaning to bear in mind when deciding whether to use "like" or "such as" to introduce an example or examples.

Use "such as" to introduce examples that have no special significance: British universities founded in the 1960s, **such as** Sussex and York. Sussex and York are no more typical of 1960s universities than Stirling, Warwick or any other; they are just examples. 

Use "like" when you wish to indicate that the instance you are quoting is in some way a prime example, or one against which the others can be measured: Substances **like** bourgeornal could be used for IVF treatment. Many elder statesmen **like** Nelson Mandela opposed the war.

In the first example, not all substances or international figures fit the bill. In the second, to say "statesmen such as Mandela" fails to acknowledge his status and thus weakens the statement.

There is a comprehensive discussion of "like" vs "such as" on the [Alt.Usage.English](http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxlike00.html) website.

# longitude

See [degrees](#degrees).

# Los Alamos preprint server

Always point to the main server at [arXiv.org](#arxivorg).

# low Earth orbit

No hyphen: it's an Earth orbit that’s low, not an orbit that has something to do with "low Earth", whatever that might be.

# Lyon

Not even a Brit would pronounce the French city "lions", so spell it the way the French do: **Lyon** *not* Lyons.

# McDonald's

The burger chain. Note the Mc and cap D, and the apostrophe.

# magazines

See titles [newspapers, magazines, journals, reports and journal articles](#newspapers-magazines-journals-reports-and-journal-articles).

# -making, -maker

Always hyphenate in decision-making, film-maker, policy-maker, etc.

# Marseille

As with Lyon, nobody pronounces the s at the end of the British spelling, so what's the point of having it there?

# master's

(as in a master's degree) lower-case m, with an apostrophe.

# media

When used to talk about TV, radio, newspapers, the internet and so on: singular when used as collective term, plural when discussing different things. eg: Social media **is** a cesspit of lies. The media **is** full of inflated egos. Different media often give different versions of events.

By the way, people who talk to the dead are mediums.

# medical conditions

In general, avoid passive words that imply someone is a victim. Instead, use language that respects people with a medical condition or disability as individuals. 

Avoid language that implies a person as a whole is disabled, e.g. **disabled person**... or that equates people with their condition, e.g. **epileptic**, **schizophrenic**, **amputee**, **the disabled**, **the mentally ill**. 

Prefer: **person/child/someone with/who has X**, e.g. **people who have schizophrenia, individuals with epilepsy, person with an amputation, individuals with paraplegia, people with disabilities**, **people with a mental illness or psychiatric disability, individual who had a stroke, people who have multiple sclerosis**.

See [autism](#autism) for an exception to these general rules. (See also [mental health](#mental-health)).

The American Psychological Association has a useful [guide to language use relating to](http://www.apastyle.org/manual/related/nonhandicapping-language.aspx) [disability and disease](http://www.apastyle.org/manual/related/nonhandicapping-language.aspx) as does the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication/inclusive-language-words-to-use-and-avoid-when-writing-about-disability).

Avoid common phrases that associate impairments with negative things, eg blind drunk, deaf to our pleas.

See also [Deaf and deaf](#deaf-and-deaf). See also [birth defects](#birth-defects). See also [disfigurement](#disfigurement).

# mental health

Words to avoid, or be careful about using: 

disease. Prefer **condition**, **illness** or **mental health problems** 

disorder. Prefer **condition**, **illness** or **mental health problems** 

psycho. Prefer **person who has experienced psychosis**. 

Schizo. Prefer **person with schizophrenia**. 

A schizophrenic, a depressive. Prefer someone "**with a diagnosis of depression**", "**experiencing depression**", or "**being treated for depression**". 

The mentally ill. Mentally ill person, victim, afflicted, sufferer. Prefer **people with mental health problems**. 

Prisoners or inmates (in a psychiatric hospital). Prefer **mental health patients**, **patients**, **people being treated**. 

Released (from a hospital). Prefer **discharged**. 

Happy pills. Prefer **antidepressants**, **medication** or **prescription drugs**.

Terms to use: **Condition**, **Illness**, **Mental health problems**, **Person with schizophrenia/anxiety**, **Someone with depression**, **Individual with a diagnosis of X**, **Person who has experienced psychosis**, **Person with mental health problems**, **Antidepressants**, **Medication**, **Prescription drugs**.

Avoid slurs such as 'crazy', 'mad' or 'fruit loop'.

Other common language mistakes relating to mental health: "Schizophrenic" or "bipolar" should not be used to mean "two minds" or a "split personality" or be used metaphorically to describe something with two different sides.

A person who is down or unhappy is not the same as someone experiencing clinical depression. However, too many formal-sounding terms can be clunky and awkward to read, so overall try to aim for a respectful but non-medical tone.

Read more in [media guidelines issued by the Time to Change programme to end the discrimination faced by people with mental health problems](http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/sites/default/files/TtC-Media-Leaflet-NEWS.pdf)

# meteorological terms

Use upper case when preceding the official names of storms and hurricanes, eg **Cyclone Zoe**, **Hurricane Ike**, **Typhoon Nina**.

# micron

Don't use (use **micrometre**, instead).

# mid-

Takes a hyphen when applied to periods of time: **mid-19th century, mid-November**.

# mini-series

Not *miniseries* (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# minuscule

Never *miniscule* (there is no such word, despite what the MS Word spellchecker and various dictionaries say).

# miscarriage

Don't use the term spontaneous abortion. Also avoid any language or terminology that could imply blame, eg 'she lost her baby'.

# moon

Always lower case, even when referring to Earth's own moon.

# months

See [time (units of)(#time-units-of).

# more than

For use of "*n* times more than", see [times more than](#times-more-than).

# more than or over?

A simple rule of thumb is that "over" refers to "how much", while "more than" refers to "how many".

**More than 10 of the speakers thought Einstein was wrong.**

**In the days after the disaster, the death toll rose to more than 100.**

Where the quantity in question is something measured on a scale, rather than counted, use "over", unless the intention is to refer to the number of units rather than the sheer quantity. For example:

**The temperature rose to over 600°C.**

**The beast weighed over 100 kilograms.**

**She was in the meeting for well over 2 hours.**

When referring to something that is, strictly speaking, countable but where the numbers are large, "over" may be acceptable, for similar reasons. "Respiratory disease killed more than a million people that year" or "Over a million people died of respiratory disease" are equally acceptable. Take your pick.

# multi-touch

Hyphenated.

# musical terms

You may find [Dolmetsch Online](http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheorydefs.htm) helpful.

# Myanmar

See [Burma](#burma).

# names (biological)

(See [below](#names-people) for names of people).

## plants and animals

Use the common name rather than the systematic (Latin) name, unless the common name is vague, ambiguous or obscure. Common names are roman, lower case **red kite, great tit, lesser spotted woodpecker**, except where named after a person or place: **Grévy's zebra, Nashville warbler, Przewalski's horse**.

But systematic names may be preferable where they help clarify the story by helping to explain relationships between species. 

Genera are italicised with initial cap: ***Homo*, *Pongo*, *Rana***. Species: italicised, lower case: ***sapiens, palustris, pipiens***. Thus ***Homo* *sapiens*, *Rana* *pipiens***, which on subsequent mention may be abbreviated to ***H. sapiens*, *R. pipiens***. Subspecies, eg ***Panthera tigris baliens***, can be abbreviated to ***P. t.*** ***baliens*** on subsequent use. Note that the second part of the two-part specific name is **never** used alone. The genus in full or abbreviation must appear.

Phylum, class and order names in roman, initial cap: **Arthropoda, Insecta, Diptera**. But it's best to avoid these Latin terms: use arthropods, insects, flies. Where appropriate, put the common name in brackets: Diptera (flies).

**Family** names: in roman, initial cap. They invariably end in -idae for animals and usually a variation of -aceae for plants: **Hominidae, Ranunculaceae**. Zoologists may need to distinguish one family from another in a colloquial way, but without having recourse to common names. Hence to distinguish lizards of the Adamidae family from the Iguanidae, they might use the adjectives **ademid** or **iguanid** (note the initial lower case).

# viruses

Virus names are in roman, lower case, except when named after a person or place: **tobacco mosaic virus, Newcastle disease virus**

# bacteria

Systematic names follow the same rules as plants and animals (italic cap initial for genus; lower case italic for species): 

***Staphylococcus aureas, Mycobacterium tuberculosis***

Some genus names have acquired the status of common names, and are spelled lower case, roman: e.g. **salmonella, listeria**

# names (geographical features)

For whether names of geographical features like rivers, oceans, mountains etc take initial capital of lower case, see [geographical features](#geographical-features)

# names (people)

Subject to the [exceptions](#the-exceptions) outlined below, always refer to people by their full name on first mention, and by surname only for subsequent mentions in the same story. This applies equally to researchers, politicians and other public figures, and members of the public such as patients or their relatives. The "full name" should normally be the person's given name and surname.

Do not prefix names with Ms, Mr, Dr, Professor, Lord, Dame, Baroness, Reverend or any other titles.

Be especially careful with names of people from [China, and some other countries](#china-and-some-other-countries), in which the surname traditionally precedes any other names. When giving the full name, follow the style that the person in question uses.

Korean names don’t have initial caps on every word. They also usually have the family name first. So **Ban Ki-moon**’s family name is Ban; **Kim Jong-un**’s is Kim.

Researchers' affiliations (the university, company or other organisation where they work) should be quoted as a matter of course.

Prefer "at" if the institution has an "of" in its name, but "of" if the person is employed by the institution but has been doing their work elsewhere. If there is space, and the researcher's achievement is significant in the context of the story, then it is useful to give their claim to fame as well.

# The exceptions

• Where someone is well known by their initials, or by a given name and initial(s): 

**J. R. R. Tolkien** (not *John Tolkien* -- who on earth is that?)

**Arthur C. Clarke**

**J. Edgar Hoover**

• Where someone we are reporting on or quoting is known to have a clear preference for their name not to be in the "given name + surname" form. For example, some Indians may be known only by their initials plus surname. Some Americans may insist on an initial appearing either before or after their given name.

• Children. Use full name on first mention, but for subsequent mentions they can be referred to by their given name only. (Conversely, avoid any temptation to do the same to adults, even if they are seen as having a passive role in story.)

• Royalty -- fun as it would be to refer to "Charles Windsor, the well-known GM sceptic", it would also be silly.

• Some British peers (especially hereditary ones) who are never referred to by their ordinary name. For example, **Lord Strathclyde**, who has held several high-profile posts for the Conservatives, is never known by any other name. However, it would be silly to start calling **Robert Winston**, "the fertility expert Lord Winston of Hammersmith", to take just one example.

• In some stories, it is permissible to break with style if the tone of the piece requires it.

• In Feedback, refer to people by their first name after first mention.

# names (places)

(see [place names](#place-names))

# Nationality

Avoid giving someone's nationality unless it is relevant to the story.

# Native American

Initial caps when referring to people of Indigenous American ancestry. See also [Indigenous people](#indigenous-people).

# navy

Upper-case if it’s the official name of the navy, lower-case otherwise. (see [army](#army)) **The US Navy, the Royal Navy, the French navy**

# neoliberal

One word

# the Netherlands

Lower case t (but cap T in addresses)

# neuron

Not neurone

# New York City

Cap C for City, but lower-case s in **New York state**

# Newcastle upon Tyne

No hyphens

# newspapers

See titles [newspapers, magazines, journals and journal articles](#newspapers-magazines-journals-and-journal-articles)

# NGC

A catalogue of star clusters, nebulae and galaxies. There is a space between "NGC" and the number of the body being referred to: for example: NGC 6791

# NHS

Spell out National Health Service on first mention, and say explicitly that it is in the UK, unless the context makes this clear.

# Nobel prizes

Lower case for prize (and prizewinner) and for the name of the prize: Nobel prize, Nobel prizewinner, Nobel laureate, Nobel committee, Nobel prize for physics

And there is no need to be picky about the proper name of the prize. "Nobel prize for chemistry" will do just as well as "Nobel prize in chemistry"

# none

Takes a singular verb: "none is", *not* "none are"

# North-West Passage

Upper case and hyphenated

# numbers

When applied to countable objects, spell out numbers below 10:

**Murdoch got four ducks in a row**

**Or these companies, four have already gone bust**

For 10 and above, use numerals. Numbers up to 9999 do not take a comma. Numbers with five or more digits take a comma every three digits: so it's 1001 and 9999, but 10,000 or 345,678 or 1,048,576.

Try to avoid putting these numbers at the start of a sentence, but if this is unavoidable, spell them out.

It is permissible to spell out round numbers such as hundred, thousand, million when they are being used to convey a rough order of magnitude rather than a precise count.

# Quantities (numbers that apply to a unit)

Always use numerals for numbers relating to quantities (such as SI units or sums of money) or numbers on a scale, even when less than 10:

**It takes 8 minutes for sunlight to reach us**

**A single dose of vaccine costs \$3**

**There are nine telescopes all in a straight line, set 2 kilometres apart**

**A 2-kilogram meteorite was found in the garden**

**The subjects gave the food a bitterness rating of 4 on a scale of 1 to 10**

(But note different rules for [days, weeks, months, years, etc](#days-weeks-months-years-etc))

Avoid starting sentences with numbers attached to a unit

# oestrogen

Not estrogen

# OK

Not "okay"

# Olympic games

Lower-case g

# On the Origin of Species

The preferred title for Charles Darwin’s seminal work. (Its full title is *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*, which is a bit too long).

# onto

One word, except where "on" is part of a fixed phrase that includes the preceding verb

# Oort cloud

Lower-case c for cloud

# orca or killer whale?

Both are OK -- and try to use both in an article for the sake of both SEO and variety.

# Origin of Species

See [On the Origin of Species](#on-the-origin-of-species).

# over or more than?

See [more than](#more-than).

# Palestinian territories

Lower case t and plural

# Pap smear

Capital P (the technique is named after its inventor, Georgios Papanikolaou)

# Paris Agreement

[Capitalised thus](http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf)

# parliament

Use lower case p, except where the name stands alone for a particular parliament:

The British parliament debated the issue last week

The prime minister told Parliament that education spending would rise. Always use lower-case for parliamentary

# party

Lower-case p in the names of political parties: **Labour party, Democratic party**, etc.

# patients

People who are ill should not automatically be referred to as patients, still less as victims of whatever disease they have. Far better where possible to refer to them "people with [a particular condition](#medical-conditions)

# per cent

Two words, and always spell out in text. Percentage is one word. In graphics, % (closed up to the number) is permissible.

Take care when comparing percentages. If the proportion of the population owning a mobile phone rises from 60 per cent to 75 per cent, the proportion has not increased by 15 per cent but by one-quarter (or 25 per cent, if you prefer).

# pH

Lower-case p, cap H (no italics)

# the Philippines

Lower-case t

# phosphorus

Note the -rus ending for the name of the element. The word "phosphorous" appeared in *New Scientist* 21 times over 15 years, but only five instances were even arguably correct: the rest are misspellings of phosphorus.

# phytoestrogen

Not "phyto-oestrogen", even though that is how it is pronounced.

# pill

Lower case p for the contraceptive pill

# place names

When quoting country, state, or county names after the name of a town, set commas before and after: as in **Floods hit Houston, Texas, last week**. It is not necessary to give the country for a city if an overwhelming majority of English speakers worldwide can be assumed to know where it is. Examples would include Paris, Rome, Athens, Berlin, Madrid, Moscow, Beijing, and Tokyo. If in doubt, give the country.

Use the anglicised names that appear in the Oxford dictionaries (**Cologne**, *not* Köln; **Florence**, *not* Firenze, etc) except for the following: [Hannover](#hannover), [Lyon](#lyon), [Marseille](#marseille).

When a name does not appear in the Oxford dictionaries, follow the *Times Atlas*.

For addresses in Letters and the Last Word, add the country name at the end.

## British

Always say explicitly that a place is in the UK, unless it is London or the context makes it clear. For example, **A team of doctors based in Bristol in the UK found…**

**Researchers at the University of Manchester in the UK…**

For addresses in Letters and the Last Word, give the county for all cities except

- London

- Aberdeen

- Bath

- Belfast

- Birmingham

- Bristol

- Brighton

- Cardiff

- Edinburgh

- Glasgow

- Leeds

- Liverpool

- Manchester

- Milton Keynes

- Newcastle upon Tyne

- Southampton

- Sheffield

- Swansea

- any town that has the same root as the "shire" name (Northampton, Derby, York, etc).

Add UK at the end (even for London)

## US

In text, do not include "US" in the location -- we can assume that the vast majority of readers will recognise the names of US states and major cities. Do give the state name, except when referring to the following cities:

- Boston

- New York

- Chicago

- Seattle

- San Francisco

- Los Angeles

- Washington DC (which is not in a state anyway)

For the suburbs of Washington DC (Beltsville, Arlington, etc) quote the name of the town and the state (Beltsville, Maryland; Arlington, Virginia) *not* "near Washington DC".

For addresses in Letters and the Last Word, include the name of the state for all cities except New York and Washington DC. Add "US" at the end.

## Australia

Unless the context makes it clear, always say explicitly that a place is in Australia, except for:

- Melbourne

- Brisbane

- Sydney

For affiliations in normal text, the state name can be an unnecessary roadblock to readers, so add state names only when such geographical clarity is relevant to the story.

For addresses in Letters and the Last Word, include the name of the state except for the cities listed above (Canberra is in ACT - the Australian Capital Territory). Add "Australia" at the end (except after South Australia and Western Australia).

## Canada

Unless the context makes it clear, always say explicitly that a place is in Canada, except for:

- Edmonton

- Montreal

- Ottawa

- Quebec

- Toronto

- Vancouver

For affiliations in normal text, the province name can be an unnecessary roadblock to readers, so add state names only when such geographical clarity is relevant to the story.

For addresses in Letters and the Last Word include the name of the province (except for the cities listed above) and add "Canada" at the end.

## China

For affiliations in normal text, the province name is unnecessary, but add it if geographical location is relevant, with "province" lower-cased thus.

# Congo

It's **Democratic Republic of the Congo** (note the definite article, lower-case t) for the country whose capital is Kinshasa and was formerly known as Zaire; the smaller **Republic of the Congo** has its capital in Brazzaville.

# regions

Like this:

- **eastern Europe**

- **western Europe**

- **sub-Saharan Africa**

- **West Africa**

- **Middle East**

- **Far East** (though **east Asia** is better)

- **South-East Asia**

US:

- **Midwest**

- **Southwest** when referring to the US region. Otherwise south-west

- **West Coast**: initial caps when used as a name for the region of the US (California, Oregon). But lower case when used as a description of the coast: **Whales in the Pacific off the west coast of the US**

- **Pacific Northwest**

See also [West](#west-western) for "the Western world", etc.

# planets

Name with initial caps, including adjectives:

**Mars/Martian; Saturn/Saturnian; Venus/Venusian; Jupiter/Jovian, etc.**

# plurals

In general follow the style in the Oxford dictionaries; where there are alternatives, use the one cited first. The words [antenna](#antenna), [formula](#formula), and [index](#index) have different plurals, depending on context.

# pole

Initial caps for North Pole and South Pole when referring to the geographical location:

**Scott's expedition reached the South Pole in 1912**

But all lower case for the south pole of other planets, or in most geophysical contexts:

**Expect trouble when the solar wind's magnetic field points towards the Earth's south pole**

# poo/poop

Avoid: they are too childish, as is "number 2". Avoid "shit" and "crap" because they are swearwords. "Turd" doesn't travel well.

Here are some alternatives you can use. Please feel free to come up with other inventive ways to squeeze out a descriptor:

## nouns

Faeces  

Dung  

Guano  

Manure  

Droppings  

Excrement  

Excreta  

Stool  

Faecal matter  

Scat

## verbs

Defecate  

Go to the bathroom  

Go to the toilet  

Produce a stool  

Relieve oneself  

Evacuate  

Egest  

Expel  

Void

# possessive

For proper names ending in s, generally add **'s** to form the possessive (**Jones's, James's**), but note that the hospital in London calls itself St Thomas' Hospital.

Use apostrophes in phrases such as **4 years' illness**, **100 hours' testing** (but *not* in 4 years of illness, etc). If in doubt, ask yourself if you would use the possessive if it was just 1 year's illness or 1 hour's testing. If the answer is yes, then you need the possessive plural when the period is several hours, years, etc.

For plural nouns that end in a letter other than s, form the possessive by adding **'s** (**other people's ideas, children's toys**, **women's magazines**). How could it be any other way? There are, after all, no such words as womens or childrens.

# practice/practise

With a c it's a noun, with an s it's a verb. See [licence/license](#licence-license). Think "advise" and "advice". Practice makes perfect.

# pregnancy

When talking about pregnancy, use the scientific terms for stages of development: embryo, fetus, etc. Don't use baby until after birth, unless in a quote.

We aim to be as inclusive as possible in our language around pregnancy. For this reason, use phrases such as 'during pregnancy' when talking generally about pregnancy, unless it is a very short news story reporting on a study that only looked at a specific group, such as pregnant women. Whenever you describe a specific study, ensure you are clear about who the study included (e.g., 100 pregnant women).

In longer pieces, always include any relevant studies about trans men or non-binary people, and if there aren't any, state that.

In all stories, it is good practice to ask researchers being interviewed about trans men and non-binary people.

Don't use 'pregnant people' in headlines, straps, and social copy. It is acceptable to use pregnant people in the body copy if there is no way to use phrasing such as 'during pregnancy', but some people object to this phrasing so it's best practice to find an alternative way of writing the sentence.

Pregnant women is fine in quotes.

In picture captions, use the caption info that comes with the image unless we have a good reason not to.

See also [miscarriage](#miscarriage)

See also [birth defects](#birth-defects)

# premier

Lower case (see [job titles and office holders](#job-titles-and-office-holders)). Avoid "premier" as a synonym for prime minister. Fine for those who are officially called premiers: the leaders of Australian states and Canadian provinces, and the premier of China.

# presently

A slightly affected synonym for "soon". Avoid using it to mean "at present", except in a direct quote.

# president

Usually lower case p (see [job titles and office holders](#job-titles-and-office-holders)).

# preventive

Not preventative

# prizes

The word "prize" in named prizes takes lower-case p. Any description that goes along with it should also be lower case (as for the [Nobel prizes](#nobel-prizes)). However, for the sake of clarity, the X Prize and its variants (Archon X Prize, etc.) should take a capital P.

# program/programme

A program is a sequence of instructions (typically executed by a computer); conferences and broadcasting stations have programmes.

# proper names

Where names of organisations or places conflict with house style, they win. So it's the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/), [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/), and so on. If in doubt, look it up.

# protocol

Lower case p in "Kyoto protocol"

# PsyArXiv

Thus.

# publishers

There is no need to give the publisher of a book mentioned in copy — unless we have a contractual agreement to do so, for instance in book reviews or Aperture.

# puma

For the species *Puma concolor* use the common name puma; in a longer story it's good to say that it's also known as a mountain lion or cougar.

# Qaida

See [Al-Qaida](#al-qaida)

# quantities

Letters representing physical quantities should be in italics: for example, E = mc^2^ 

# queen

Queen Elizabeth II, the queen of England, the queen (see [job titles and office holders](#job-titles-and-office-holders))

# quotation marks

Use double quotes generally, and single quotes in headlines and in quotes inside quotes.

When a quote is a full sentence, or ends in one, put the final punctuation mark inside the final quotation mark:

**"When I say 'stop', I mean do it now," says the subeditor.**

Avoid partial quotes if possible. There are often tidier alternatives, such as making reported speech in cases such as *Gerry said his pacemaker was "great".* Long partial quotes in long sentences can be easier to read if rephrased and/or turned into two sentences. If a sentence contains a partial quote, put the commas and full stops outside the closing quote marks, thus:

**The strange helmet-like object is the shell of the "biggest freshwater snail ever", according to Ivor Mollusc-Fetish at the Natural History Museum.**

# race

As with other personal details, only mention a person's cultural identity or skin colour if it is relevant to the story.

Race and ethnicity are two terms that are vague, complicated and used in different ways around the world. Some people think they are interchangeable while others don't. Always check with the researchers what they mean by these terms if they use them and explain their meaning in the story.

Use upper-case for Black and lower-case for white. If an individual has expressed a wish for a particular descriptor don't override it.

Never use adjectives as nouns:

**Black people**, **white participants**, etc. *not* **Blacks** or **whites**

"People of colour" is acceptable if you can't be more specific.

Ethnic minority is also acceptable if you can't be more specific, but remember that in the UK it also includes white minorities.

Avoid "non-white".

"Coloured" is offensive, except for:

- The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

- the South African group of people known as Coloured, in which case the term should be upper-cased and explained.

Always ask yourself if a racial descriptor is accurate, relevant, or required in each situation. Sometimes, as in implicit association tests, it is the best description of the matter in question; in a genetic study, one would hope for a more precise definition of a study group.

# ratios

To express ratios use numerals, separated by a colon, all closed up: as in 20:1, 5:1, etc.

# Red Planet

Initial capitals (when used as a name for Mars)

# redshift

One word

# references

Give the details of papers only sparingly: they can be roadblocks to reading. Equally, they are our direct line to the gods; they show that we aren't making stuff up.

# References to journals other than New Scientist

Use them after due consideration

- for papers that provide the immediate raison d'être for the article

- for a key paper that marks the starting point or turning point of a story

- to lend credibility to controversial statements that would otherwise lack it

Although a reference is often essential in news stories, many *New Scientist* articles will do perfectly well with no references in the copy, and very few need more than one or two. Do, however, include hyperlinks to studies in all articles.

Rarely, for stories with many conflicting claims, or where there may be additional reason for readers to want to follow up on statements -- for stories about climate change or personal health, for example -- eschew references in the text in favour of using the formulation "For links to studies relevant to this article, see the online version at newscientist.com/issue/XXXX" at the end of the article, where XXXX is the relevant issue number.

## Format

In Features and Opinion articles, references to articles from print journals should be in the [conventional format](#newspapers-magazines-journals-and-journal-articles), (*Journal Title*, vol xx, p xx) rather than as a [DOI](#doi) or URL. For example:

"…evidence shows that coral too may benefit (*Science*, vol 220, p 1047)".

For recent items, it can be more newsy to say something like:

"…Lopez reported in last week's *Nature* (vol 349, p 23)"

Where journals do not have volume numbers (notably those published by the Royal Society of Chemistry) give the year instead:

*Chemical Communications* (2002, p 458)

In Features and Opinion articles, for references to papers that have been published online in advance of print, so do not yet have volume and page numbers, use the [DOI](#doi) after the journal name. For example:

***Science*, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0401773101** (Note the space after the colon)

For papers appearing on the arXiv preprint server, give the arXiv address, e.g. arXiv.org/abs/0807.2466

See separate section for guidance on [newspapers, magazines, journals and journal articles](#newspapers-magazines-journals-and-journal-articles)

For references to papers published online, see also [DOI](#doi) and [arXiv.org](#arxivorg)

# DOI shortener

In News articles and Leaders, DOIs are used in preference to volume and page number.

Where possible, shorten DOI links using the DOI shortener available at [http://shortdoi.org/](http://shortdoi.org/)

References using a short DOI are formatted like this: (*Nature*, doi.org/j5d)

# References to previous New Scientist articles

These are useful in Feedback for referencing long-running jokes, and in the Last Word, but are unnecessary in most articles. Exceptions are when we have run a feature, leader or news story in the past couple of years that covers similar ground, that marks a significant, distinct step in the same story, or that presents an obviously contrary conclusion. This should assure regular readers that our left hand knows what the right hand is doing.

## Format

References to past *New Scientist* stories should be in the format: "*New Scientist*, issue date, page number":

*New Scientist*, 14 September 2002, p 33

Omit year when article being cited is in the current year. On the letters page, "*New Scientist*" should be dropped to avoid repetition.

Do not use page numbers for references to Feedback and The Last Word, as they vary between editions. Instead, refer to the section by name:

Feedback, *New Scientist*, 17 August 2002

In references to the **current issue**, spell out "page".

For references to online-only news stories on newscientist.com, give the article ID, but not the headline slug words after it:

**Dolphins and whales are also affected**  

(newscientist.com/article/dn14037) *not*  

newscientist.com/article/dn14037-the-worldsmost-successful-bug-hits-dolphins/

**Mice are old friends**  

(newscientist.com/article/2125939) *not*  

newscientist.com/article/2125939-mice-livedwith-us-15000-years-ago-even-before-farming-took-off/

# Further reading (at the end of features)

This is not something we do very much, if at all, these days. If you do, start with "Further reading:". Run on first reference, others to start on a new line

Books: Title in italics, author (or authors, but don't name more than three), publisher

**Further reading: *Narcotic Plants* by William Emboden (Macmillan)**

Journal or magazine articles: title (in quotes), author(s), journal name (italics), volume number and page number, date.

**"The evolution of cannabinoid phenotypes" by E. Small, H. Beksted and P. Gonzalez, *Journal of Economic Botany*, vol 29, p 254 (1974)** or with more than three authors: name lead author "and others"

**"Seasonal variation of cannabinoid content of Indian marijuana" by C. E. Turner and others, *Journal of Forensic Science*, vol 25, p 2356 (1982)**

Papers in conference proceedings or chapters in edited, multi-author reviews: Paper/chapter title (in quotes), author, volume title (italics), editor, publisher

**"Marijuana cultivation" by A. Head, in *A History of Narcotic Plants*, ed. Philip Leclerc (Oxford University Press).**

# respecting individuals' preferences

Only mention a person’s characteristics if they are relevant to the story. If they are, always refer to people in the way they wish to be referred to. This might mean using their [preferred pronouns](#transgender) ("he", "she" or "they"), [cultural identifiers](#race) and any term that relates to a [condition or disability](#medical-conditions). If in doubt, ask.

# Richter scale

A magnitude-7 quake *or* a quake of magnitude 7 *not* a 7 magnitude quake ringtone  

One word

# rivers

Lower case in most cases. e.g. Mississippi river, river Thames, but Yellow River. You can say the Thames or Mississippi, but the Yellow could be misinterpreted, so the "River" is part of the proper name.

If several rivers are mentioned in an article, some requiring upper- and some lower-case letters, make all instances of "river" lower case. See [geographical features](#geographical-features).

# RNA

No need to spell out; note the lower case m (for messenger) and t (for transfer) in mRNA and tRNA

# Royal Botanic Garden/s

The one in Edinburgh is singular; the one in London (Kew Gardens) is plural

# Sainsbury's

*Not* Sainsbury or Sainsburys; say explicitly that it is a British supermarket chain unless the context makes this unnecessary

# satnav

One word

# science fiction

Always in full when first mentioned in an article. Can be abbreviated to **sci-fi** thereafter if you want, but not **SF** unless in a quote.

"SF" is the preferred term among science fiction enthusiasts, but that doesn’t mean all our readers will know what it means at first glance.

# seas

Names take cap S North Sea, Sea of Japan  

See [geographical features](#geographical-features).

# seasons

Don’t use seasons as a lazy substitute for dates: if you mean sometime next March or April, then say so. For readers in the southern hemisphere "next spring" doesn't mean the same as it does to writers in the northern hemisphere.

Using the names of seasons to indicate the time of year is acceptable, however, if the story is clearly related to something happening in a particular hemisphere, especially if it is related to the life cycle of plants or animals, or to the weather.

# seawater

One word

# ships

Ships do not have a gender: they are "it" not "she". Their names are in roman, initial caps. If it is not clear that it's a ship, add context, as "the tanker Prestige", "the racing yacht Kingfisher 2", "the USS Midway", etc.

# sigma and p-values

When physicists are looking for particles or results in a sea of data, sigma values and *p*values describe a property of the data when compared to a specific null hypothesis, they are not properties of the hypothesis itself.

In general, if you are trying to prove hypothesis X, a Y sigma level tells you that if X was incorrect, there is a P(Y) chance of seeing the observed data anyway.

e.g. 3 sigma means that the chance of obtaining a result **like** the one that was obtained, on the hypothesis that it was just due to chance, would be about 1 in 740. It is not the chance of obtaining the result that has been seen.

[This story](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130813-100-neutrinos-hint-at-why-antimatter-didnt-blow-up-the-universe/) got praise for getting it right.

# Sindh

Province of Pakistan (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# smartcard

One word.

# smartphone

One word.

# solar system

Always lower case, even when referring to our own solar system.

# spacecraft

Names of individual craft should be in roman, initial caps. Generic name or descriptive names, all lower case. Space shuttle is a generic name, therefore lower case. Individual shuttles (Columbia, Enterprise, etc) take initial caps

# space flight

Two words

# space-time

Always hyphenated

# spelling

Follow the [Oxford Dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/) for spelling, including capitalisation and hyphenation. There is one major set of exceptions: use "-[ise](#ise)", rather than "ize" for verb endings.

Otherwise, where *Oxford* gives alternative spelling, use the one cited first.

For words that do not appear in the dictionary, make sure that the meaning is either explained or is self-evident from the context.

There are a handful of other exceptions. Please familiarise yourself with any you are likely to use in your stories.

## spelling exceptions

- **aircon** *not* air con

- **antennas** (radio) *not* antennae

- **Basel** *not* Basle

- **Bern** *not* Berne

- **cellphone** (one word)

- **chatroom** (one word)

- **disc** (computers) *not* disk

- **Earth-like** *not* Earthlike

- **foot and mouth disease** (no hyphens)

# spring

See [seasons](#seasons)

# square kilometres or kilometres squared?

The former. If space is tight, you can use km^2^ in later mentions.

# stadium

For the plural, use [stadiums](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/stadium?q=stadium) instead of stadia, in line with the Oxford Dictionaries 

# standard model

As in the standard model of physics: all lower case

# state

Generally lower case when referring to US states: state laws, state court, state legislature, etc.

Also New York state and Washington state (if it is necessary to distinguish them from the cities of the same name)

# Stone Age

Initial caps (see [Age](#Age))

# subjunctive

Use the subjunctive, where appropriate: namely, to refer to something that is hypothetical, imagined or desired. For example:

"The panel recommends that he **be** dismissed" is clearer than "...recommends that he is dismissed"

# sub-prime

With a hyphen.

# suicide

Reporting on suicide brings with it a risk of inciting copycat behaviour. With that in mind:

- Avoid giving too much detail about the means or locations of suicides

- Avoid portraying a method of suicide as being immediate or easy to imitate

- Avoid implying that suicide is down to a single cause

- Avoid images that portray popular sites of suicide

- Avoid "committing suicide"; prefer died by suicide, or died

Whenever possible try to give context and refer to the wider issues related to suicide, such as mental health problems, alcohol problems, deprivation and the lifelong effect that suicide can have on the bereaved.

Wherever possible (and always online) add details of where people considering suicide can get help:

# SUV

Stands for **sports utility vehicle** (note the s in "sports"), but no need to spell out if the context is clear.

# summer

See [seasons](#seasons)

# sun

Always lower case

# supernova

Plural is **supernovae**. There are several varieties, including, for example **type Ia, type II**

Note the lower case t and roman numerals

# swear words

(Taken from the New Scientist editorial code) Respect for the reader demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend. Use swear words only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece, or to portray a character in an article, and after consultation with the Editor. There is almost never a case in which we need to use a swear word outside direct quotes. Avoid using in headlines, pull quotes and standfirsts. Never use asterisks, which are just a cop-out.

# Sydney

See [place names](#place-names)

# taekwondo

One word

# T-cell

Always hyphenated

# telephone numbers

Always include the national code: eg **+44 (0)20 8652 3500**

# Terminator

As in the Terminator gene used in genetically engineered crops. Cap T, because the name comes from the character in the Schwarzenegger movie

# terrorist/terrorism

Avoid unless in a quote.

# testbed

One word

# that/which

These two words are not interchangeable.

That is a defining pronoun, that is, it tells a reader which one of several objects is being referred to.

**The book that flew across the room breaking the editor's nose weighed more than 1 kilogram.**

Which, on the other hand, introduces a description of an object that is already defined.

**The heaviest book, which weighed 2 kilograms, struck the editor a few seconds later** **Our house that has a red door needs painting** does not mean the same thing as **Our house, which has a red door, needs painting**.

# thiamine

A vitamin of the B-group; not to be confused with the DNA base **thymine**

# thiomersal

Not thimerosal, although it is often useful to include the US spelling in brackets.

# time

See [clock time](#clock-time)

# time (relative)

## For magazine articles

- **this week** is the Monday to Sunday including the issue date

- **next week** is the Monday to Sunday following the issue date

- **last week** is the Monday to Sunday before the issue date

- **months** likewise

## Online-only articles

Always use **today** to refer to the day on which the article is published. There is potential for confusion when people happen across the article later, but it would be more confusing to refer to today with a date. Likewise with **yesterday** and **tomorrow**.

Relative dates such as "next Tuesday" or "last Saturday" will require mental gymnastics after the day of publication, however, so are normally best avoided.

# time (units of)

For numbers of days, weeks, months, years and longer units of time, spell out whole numbers up to nine:

**The survey took five years to complete**

**They did not wake until two days later**

But treat hours, minutes and seconds like any other unit, and never spell out the numeral:

**The meteor trail was visible for 3 seconds**

**Students sat a 2-hour exam**

If you want a rule of thumb, it is that days and years (and to a lesser degree, years and months) are real, countable things: you don't need a clock to tell you when a day or a year has gone by. Numbers of days and years should therefore follow the rule for other countable things -- see [numbers](#numbers).

And to make things even more complicated, there is a further exception to these rules: use numerals for ages, even if they are measured in days, years, etc.

**At 6 months old, the fish were fully grown Most 8-year-olds can read simple stories**

# times more than

Think twice before using constructions such as **four times more than**

Many people insist that "four times more than 1 tonne" means 5 tonnes not 4 tonnes, and

"four times more than the number of seconds in a minute" is 300 not 240. Use **four times as much as** or **four times as many as** instead, as this construction cannot be misinterpreted.

However, if the factor in question is large, and the comparison is approximate, the "times more than" construction is harmless: 100 times or 101 times the original size - who cares?

# titles

## books, films, plays, TV programmes, songs, records, works of art, etc

Italicise titles, and capitalise the first letter of every word, except for a, and, for, from, in, of, the, to (except, of course, when they are at the start of the title):

***A Brief History of Time; On the Origin of Species***

For subtitles, cap up the first letter of the first word only:

***Four Colours Suffice: How the map problem was solved***  

Respect American spellings if that is what the title itself uses

# musical works with numbers

**Beethoven's ninth symphony** *not* Ninth Symphony *nor* Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125 (sometimes known simply as "the Choral")

# newspapers, magazines, journals, reports and journal articles

Set the titles of printed journals, newspapers, reports and magazines in italics, and get the title right, including upper-case letters at the start of words. That means using the correct spelling, which may be British (as in ***Animal Behaviour***), or American (as in ***Evolution and Human Behavior***). It also normally means including "***The***" as part of the title when that is what the publication itself does (and not when it doesn't). In running text it is permissible to drop the "*The*" when to keep it would makes the sentence awkward or unnecessarily complicated.

If you need to refer to titles of papers or articles, they should appear in roman (not italic), within quotes, with an initial cap for the first word only. See also [journals](#journals)

# people

See [names (people)(#names-people)

# touchscreen

One word

# trans fats

Two words

# transgender

If we mention a specific person, always use the name, descriptive term and pronoun they prefer.

## Terms to use

- **transgender**

- **trans:** transgender people prefer this term, but we should use "transgender" first as readers may be unfamiliar with the term "trans".

- **transition**: the process of changing gender presentation. This encompasses social, medical and surgical changes.

- **Cisgender and cis people**: people whose gender identity matches that assigned at birth. Use when useful to be specific, but it should be explained on first mention.

## Terms to avoid

- **sex change**, **sex swap**: transition is the preferred term. If talking specifically about any of the surgical procedures involved, name them or use "**gender confirmation surgery**".

- **pre-op, post-op**

- **born male**, **born female**: use **assigned male at birth**, **assigned female at birth**

- **biologically male/female, genetically male/female**: these terms are reductive and oversimplify a complex subject. Again, use **assigned male at birth** or **assigned female at birth**.

- **bathroom bill**: this term was created by those that oppose non-discrimination laws. Instead, refer to the title of the law, use **non-discrimination bill**, or word in a way to avoid the problem - for example, "legislators arguing about who gets to use each bathroom".

- **trapped in the wrong body**

Some things to remember:

- A transgender man transitions from female to male and usually uses the pronoun "he", a transgender woman from male to female and usually uses the pronoun "she".

- Transgender is an adjective -- there are transgender people, but not transgenders or a transgender.

- Don't confuse gender identity with sexuality (for this reason transgender stories shouldn't be tagged with the "sexuality" topic online).

- Don't use the previous name, identity or photos of any named people without their permission. If you are unsure, speak to subs.

- Avoid overemphasising the role of surgery when discussing transgender people, or the process of transition; not all transgender people choose to, or can afford to, undergo medical surgeries.

- Avoid referencing medical histories of transgender people unless it is directly relevant to the story and we have their permission.

- It is good practice to centre trans people's voices in stories about trans issues.

Media guidelines for writing about transgender issues and glossaries of other terms not mentioned here can be found at:

[http://www.transmediawatch.org/Documents/Media-Style-Guide.pdf](http://www.transmediawatch.org/Documents/Media-Style-Guide.pdf)  

For definitions of other gender nonbinary terms, [*National Geographic*](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/01/explore-gender-glossary-terminology/) has a good glossary.

# treaties

Initial caps if it's the full and proper title. Eg

[**Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty**](https://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/content/treaty/treaty_text.pdf)

[**Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons**](https://web.archive.org/web/20070807060917/http:/www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf)  

*but* **the non-proliferation treaty**

# trillion

Means a thousand billion, but use with care. With such a large number it will often be clearer to say 10^12^.

Use 10^15^ rather than quadrillion, unless you are deliberately setting out to put dramatic effect ahead of clarity.

# trojan

Computer viruses, trojans and worms are all in lower case.

# try to/try and

We try to do things. We try to end killing. We try to avoid mistakes. We try to avoid "try and" in written copy. If we were to try and avoid "try to" we would be performing two actions -- trying and avoiding.

# Tutankhamun

An [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/)

# UK

Use "the UK" rather than [Britain](http://oxforddictionaries.com/) (except in rare historical references going back before 1801)

# Ukraine

Not "the Ukraine"

# UN

No need to spell out

# under way

*Not* underway

# units

(See also [numbers](#numbers))

# in text

Always express measurements in SI units, except for a few rare exceptions (see below). The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill hosts a useful [site on SI units](http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/)

Where necessary use the [](http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html#4.4) (milli, kilo, etc). When comparing quantities, avoid comparing units with different prefixes -- find more direct way of expressing the difference in magnitude. For instance, compare a coal-fired power station of 500-megawatt capacity with a hydroelectric generator that is **more than three times as powerful** *not* a 1.7gigawatt hydroelectric generator. Use **gigatonnes** *not* billions of tonnes

Spell out all units on first mention except °C; note that the names of SI units and prefixes all begin with lower-case letters. Where units are repeated several times, they can be abbreviated after the first mention. Use the recognised SI abbreviations

The exceptions, where non-SI units should be used, are:

**altitude of aircraft (feet is more usual)** **nuclear yield (use kilotons and megatons)** and when quoting someone, even indirectly, who would not themselves have used SI: "**Jones insisted he was 6000 miles away in California at the time**"

When converting to SI, don't use foolishly over-precise conversions. If the base figure is 1000 miles, then don't quote it as 1609 kilometres; 1600 kilometres will usually be plenty precise enough, and sometimes 1500 kilometres might be better still. You may have to make a judgement on how precise the original figure was.

# in graphics

Units can be abbreviated. Numbers should be set **closed up** to abbreviated units **universe**

Always lower case.

# universities

Use their full, correct names in all cases (except the very few listed below) Be guided by the university's own website if in any doubt. For those in non-English-speaking countries, translate the name as well.

If a university has campuses in more than one place, don't specify a campus unless that information is relevant -- if, for instance, the research is being done in a campus outside the university's home country.

There are two indexes to university websites on the web: a state-by-state listing for [American universities](http://univ.cc/states.php) and a country-by-country listing for [universities in the rest of the world](http://univ.cc/world.php)

# US

For universities that do not have their location or state as part of their name, make sure that is included:

**Baylor College of Medicine in Texas,** **Kent State University in Ohio**

Exceptions to these rules:

- **Harvard University, Yale University and Princeton University**: no need to give their location

- **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**: can be abbreviated to MIT after the first mention, or in short (one or two-paragraph stories), or if referred to only in passing

- **California Institute of Technology in Pasadena** (can be abbreviated to Caltech after first mention, or in short stories or if referred to only in passing)

# Rest of world

Give the country, even when it's the UK, unless the university is in an exceptionally well-known place. The only exceptions are Oxford and Cambridge. For example:

**University of Nottingham in the UK**, or **University of Nottingham, UK,**

**Brunel University, UK,**

**University of Edinburgh in the UK**

**Northumbria University at Newcastle in the UK** (there's nowhere officially called Northumbria)

**University of Oxford**

**University College London** (everyone knows where London is)

**Imperial College London** (no comma)

**Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada**

**McGill University in Montreal**

**University of Newcastle, Australia** **Gothenburg University in Sweden**

**University of Tokyo** (no need to say Japan)

## France

For the Paris universities, use the name (if there is one) rather than the numbers:

- **Panthéon-Sorbonne University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris I**

- **Panthéon-Assas University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris II**

- **New Sorbonne University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris III**

- **Sorbonne University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris IV**

- **Descartes University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris V**

- **Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris VI**

- **Denis Diderot University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris VII**

- **University of Paris VIII**

- **Dauphine University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris IX**

- **Nanterre University, Paris** *not* **University of Paris X**

- **University of Paris-South** *not* **University of Paris XI**

- **Val-de-Marne University, France** *not* **University of Paris XII**

- **University of Paris-North** *not* **University of Paris XIII**

## Germany

Some older German universities have resounding names like Georg-August University of Göttingen, or Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen. For these, a simple **University of Göttingen**, or **University of Tübingen** will suffice, unless there is more than one university in the city in question (Berlin and Munich are examples).

## Belgium

There are two separate universities called the Free University of Brussels: the **Free University of Brussels (ULB)** is French-speaking; then there is the **Free University of Brussels (VUB)**, which is Flemish-speaking. To avoid ambiguity, include the initials when referring to these institutions.

In the nearby bilingual city of Louvain/Leuven, there are two Catholic universities: the Flemish-speaking **KU Leuven**, and the French-speaking **Catholic University of Louvain**.

# URLs in print

This entry relates to the way web addresses appear in print in *New Scientist*: that is, what readers of the print magazine will see, not what readers see online. Nor does this apply to the URLs that appear inside notes in stories being prepared for print.

We can assume that readers can recognise URLs for what they are, even when they don't start with "www", so do not prefix web URLs with "http//" or "http//www." unless there is some particular reason for doing so. For example, references to the preprint archive should take the form: **arXiv.org/hep-ex/0003001**

# newscientist.com URLS

newscientist.com is all lower case.

For references to online-only news stories on newscientist.com, use the URL up to the end of the article ID number, omitting the headline words, as in these examples:

**It's not clear how the Roschach test works (newscientist.com/article/mg23431200-500)**

**An image-learning system can distinguish giraffes from gazelles**

**(newscientist.com/article/2127541)**

**Dolphins and whales are also affected (newscientist.com/article/dn14037).**

To refer back to stories that appeared in print, use the [print reference](#print-reference) style.

For **references to articles on newscientist.com for which there is no ID number** -- to old blog articles or landing pages, for example -- use a bit.ly to shorten the URL (see below) and ensure that the context indicates what it's pointing to. For example:

**See newscientist.com blog post at bit.ly/73g7X.**

# shortening URLs

Long URLs look ugly and are difficult to type accurately if readers want to use them. They should be replaced by a shortened version. Please log in to the [bit.ly](http://bitly.com/) site (credentials via Passbolt) to generate the short URL. Logging in will allow you to use our custom newscienti.st/ short URL, if we haven't used our monthly quota already, and to customise the end of the URL to something user-friendly. Wherever possible, the text should indicate to readers where the bit.ly URL will take them. For example:

Subditors have been killed in ongoing street battles over style points in the US [bit.ly/SubDeaths](http://bit.ly/SubDeaths).

Note on bitly to subs: When a bitly URL appears in the Soho font, use the font variant with serifs, to distinguish between the 1 (numeral), l (lower-case l) and I (cap I) characters. To select this variant go to the Character panel, choose the flyout menu, and then choose OpenType > Stylistic Sets > Set 1.

# US

*Not* USA. There is hardly ever any need to spell out United States, even at first mention. **America** is preferable in some contexts ("God bless the US" would sound silly). Avoid using "American" if you mean the people or products of the US because everybody in North America and South America is American.

# uterus

Use this unless womb works better in the context.

# utopia

Lower case, as is **utopian**

# valleys

lower case:

**The Tennessee valley; the Great Rift valley Silicon Valley is an exception**

# variables

Letters representing mathematical variables should be in italics. For example, in a league of *n* teams, there will be *n*(*n* - 1) games if all the teams play each other both at home and away.

# versus

For the abbreviation, use vs (lower case, no full stop). On the cover, v is acceptable.

# victim

Defined by *Oxford Dictionaries* as "a person harmed, injured or killed as a result of a crime, accident or other event or action". It may be OK to refer to people killed in, say, a plane crash as "victims". But to refer to someone with a disease or even an injury as its "victim", is to place them in a passive role which some may find objectionable. It is best to avoid using the word in these situations. Similarly, many people who have experienced sexual assault, for example, don't like being called victims.

# video games

See [computer games](#computer-games) 

# viruses

Virus names are in roman, and lower case .

**influenza, vaccinia.**

except for those named after a person or place, which use initial cap for that word: EpsteinBarr virus, Newcastle disease virus, Semliki Forest virus.

Note that virus (singular) can also be used as a mass noun. "The quantity of virus in the bloodstream", for example, refers to quantity of the same species of virus. To say "the quantity of viruses..." would imply that many species were present.

# vitamins

Numbers should be subscript

# VoIP

Stands for **voice over internet protocol** (no caps, no hyphens). But in casual references it may be better to describe it as "VoIP, a system for carrying phone conversations over internet", or something similar

# vortex

Plural vortices

# war

Lower-case w. Names of wars all lower case: e.g.

**first world war, second world war, cold war, Vietnam war, Iran-Iraq war**

# water grab

Two words (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to Oxford [dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/)), but water-grabber and water-grabbing. The same applies to [land](#land).

# web

Lower case, and likewise for web page, web address (but three cap Ws for the World Wide Web, in the unlikely event that you ever need to refer to it that way).

# website

One word

# weeks

See [time (units of)](#time-(units-of))

# West, Western

Upper case W for West and Western

# West Nile virus

Capital W; similarly, West Nile disease

# whistleblower

One word (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to [Oxford dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# white paper

Government proposals on an issue (an [exception](#spelling-exceptions) to [Oxford dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com/))

# Wi-Fi

A family of protocols for wireless networking

# winter

See [seasons](#seasons)

# womb

See [uterus](#uterus)

# World Conservation Union

See [IUCN](#iucn)

# World Cup

Initial caps (specify which sport)

# WWF

The organisation that used to be known as the World Wide Fund for Nature (or World Wildlife Fund in the US) now wishes to be known simply by its initials.

If the context does not make it self-evident that WWF is a conservation organisation, then this should be stated explicitly.

# X-ray

Cap X

# xxx.lanl.gov

A mirror site for the Cornell University preprint server. For consistency, always point to the main site, which is at [www.arXiv.org](http://arxiv.org)

# years
